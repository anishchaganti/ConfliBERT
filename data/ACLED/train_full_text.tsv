"VADODARA/RAJKOT: The decision by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to send a team to Vadodara to inspect the records of the Best Bakery trial does not seem to have gone down well amongst a section of lawyers here.These lawyers a"" including some defence counsel a"" on Saturday submitted a memorandum seeking contempt of court proceedings against NHRC, calling its comments on the case as an insult to the dignity of the court.The lawyers submitted a memorandum to fast-track court Justice HU Mahida requesting him to make a reference to the Gujarat High Court in connection with the recent statement made by NHRC chairman, Justice A S Anand.Mahida had heard the Best Bakery case and delivered the judgment recently, acquitting all the accused persons.Commenting on the move to check the documents, the memorandum states, ""In our perception, such an attempt either on part of the chairman of commission or commissions is a very serious act of insult of the dignity of courts and the same is ultra vires intervention in the august process of judicial adjudication.""The memorandum adds that the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, did not give any power and authority in favour of the commission or its members to pass unilateral mandate addressed to the judge whereby they declare that the trial was suffering from some deficiencies.It states that the Act nowhere empowered the commission to suo motu take up the case as it at no point of time involved any complaint or allegation regarding the violation of human rights.""The statement as published in the local newspapers clearly and vocally gives impression from its plain meaning that the commission or its chairman are empowered and acting as if they are watchdog over the judicial proceedings,"" the memorandum states.

Both Jain and Joshi were part of the panel that defended the Best Bakery carnage accused.Commenting on the move, Jain said, ""The NHRC's decision has come as a surprise to many of us.

"VADODARA: This city may be three times smaller than Ahmedabad, but commercial property owners here pay much more property tax than those in Ahmedabad.A recent study by the Vadodara Chambers of Commerce & Industry (VCCI) and the Federation of Gujarat Industries (FGI) reveals that businessmen in Vadodara pay 33 per cent more property tax than their counterparts in Ahmedabad under the much-hyped property tax scheme of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation implemented from April 1. This, despite the fact that Vadodara is a 'B' category city compared Ahmedabad's 'A' category statusa""a grading given on basis of the rate of development and quality of civic amenities.The study also indicates discriminatory aspects like tax factors for areas like RC Dutt Road, Gorwa and Gotri in Vadodara. They fall under 'prosperous' zone of Rs 2-Rs 3.40 higher per square metre compared to CG Road and Ashram Road in Ahmedabad.This difference in scales is higher than Rs 6-Rs 10 per square metre for areas falling under 'poor' zone like Tarsali in Vadodara and Dariapur in Ahmedabad.The VCCI survey points out that ultimate rate for commercial properties in posh areas up to 20 years is worked out at Rs 2 per square metre less than that in similar locations in Ahmedabad.Those falling between age category of 21 and 40 and above are almost Rs 3 per square metre more than that in Ahmedabad. The study brings to note that areas coming under 'good', 'medium' and 'poor' locations have their ultimate tax rates increasing proportionately with the age of the property.aA property owner in 'poor' category has to pay Rs 9.60 per square metre more than his counterpart in Ahmedabad if the age of the property is less than 10 years,a says VCCI executive member JH Vohra. aRates go up to Rs 10.32 for properties aged more than 30 years. A 25-year property with an area of 215 square metres in 'class four' category with a 15 per cent discount, since it falls under non-water zone, would pay Rs 6,198 as yearly tax as compared to Rs 3,426 in Ahmedabad,a adds Vohra.aIf you make a comparison between Ahmedabad and Vadodara, a commercial property in Alkapuri would cost Rs 32,000 per square metre while that on CG Road in Ahmedabad would cost around Rs 28,000. For areas like Tarsali, the price is almost Rs 12,900 while that of poor areas in Ahmedabad it would be about Rs 12,000,a says structural engineer and real estate dealer from Ahmedabad Vijay Shah.aThe reason for this stark difference may be the rate at which Vadodara is developing and its so-called cosmopolitan culture,a reasons Shah Senior VMC officials argue that current trends in real estate prices and the old system of taxation, which has not been revised for the past eight years, are to be blamed.aThere are several properties in the city which have been exempted from tax under the old system. Under the new structure calculated on the basis of age, location, type of use and ownership, we have managed to bring these properties under tax net as they are enjoying civic amenities,a says town planner Gopal Shah.aWe were told to choose factors between 0.5 and 1.0 for each category of multipliers. The range was finalised by the government. It's because we did not go as low as Ahmedabad by choosing values as low as 0.5 that ultimate tax rates worked out more than Vadodara,a says mayor NV Patel."	1
HYDERABAD: Nearly 40 per cent of the land earmarked as lung spaces in posh Jubilee Hills has been encroached upon by the city's top guns, including politicians, IAS and IPS officers.This discovery was made by a team of Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad officials, which set out to identify the open spaces as per the lay-out plan.aThe encroachers are obviously the most influential people who have the right connections,a officials said, adding this would not have been possible without the connivance of the officers concerned.As per the original lay-out, 40 per cent of the 1,400 acres falling under Jubilee Hills was meant to be left open. In other words, about 560 acres of land was to be left for roads, parks, play grounds and community centres. But the MCH team found that nearly 250 acres of this has been converted into private constructions.The land sharks have been so blatant that one of them, Shilpa Marbles, lay siege to a large piece of land worth several crores close to the chief minister's house, from where they run their business.In the middle of this murky business, it is learnt, is the Jubilee Hills Co-operative Society which makes the lay-out plans in the area. According to officials, the society first prepares a lay-out plan and accordingly develops the colony.And once the construction of houses is complete, they submit a revised plan in which they show the constructed area as open spaces and get the clearance done, maintaining the 60:40 ratio of plots and open spaces. This way the open spaces are converted into plots and sold again, the officials said.	1
"AHMEDABAD: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and BJP national president M Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday paid floral tributes to slain BJP leader and former Gujarat home and revenue minister Haren Pandya at his residence ''Neelam''.Advani and Naidu were accompanied by Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Union ministers Arun Jaitley and Kashi Ram Rana, BJP national treasurer Harin Pathak and others. The two leaders placed wreaths on the body of Pandya, who was shot dead here on Wednesday, and also consoled the bereaved family.Earlier, Advani and Naidu who arrived in a special Air Force plane at Sardar Patel airport were received by Modi, senior Cabinet ministers and other leaders.Both the leaders drove straight to Pandya''s residence in Paldi area.On arrival of Advani and other leaders at the residence of the slain leader, party workers shouted slogans ""We want justice""."	1
AHMEDABAD: It's like the classic race between the hare and tortoise. Two weeks after the cold-blooded murder of former minister Haren Pandya, the entire case has begun to focus on five persons, who are residents of Ahmedabad and are suspected to have undergone ISI training in Karachi.Some police officials are convinced that they were probably involved in the Pandya killing.This, at a time when the CBI is trying to piece together the jigsaw and ascertain the motive behind the murder without jumping the gun.For the Ahmedabad city crime branch, it is a case of a 'bird in hand is better than two in the bush'! The lesser known fact here being that the entire operation was conducted on intelligence acquired by the central Intelligence Bureau (IB), which tipped off the city police about some local persons having been trained by the ISI, recently.The crime branch last week swooped down on five persons who are said to have confessed to their ISI links. The information with the local police was on two batches of people from Gujarat who had undergone this kind of training and indoctrination into 'jihad' in Pakistan. Of which, the crime branch claims to have got the 'second batch'. The local network, surely gave the crime branch an edge over the CBI and the operation was conducted without much delay on Wednesday night.In fact, even after the case was handed over to the CBI, in a speedy response by the state and Central government, the city crime branch went ahead with its own line of investigation and was about to book the five accused for alleged involvement in the conspiracy and murder of Pandya, say police sources.Later senior officials intervened in the matter, and it was treated as an inde pendent case. All said and done, the investigations now have begun to concentrate on a dozen-odd individuals, five of who are in custody of the crime branch till April 16, and the remaining six are absconding. Ahmedmiyan Sukhiyaan Patangiya, among them who is at large, is believed to hold the key to the Pandya murder or murderer.A top official admitted that the crime branch had delved deep into the Pandya case and was indeed conducting parallel investigations. Unfortunately, although the CBI has flown in its top officials from Delhi to boost the morale of its team, they were compelled to interrogate five accused caught by the crime branch at the Gaekwad Haveli week. Although 'disturbed' at statements being made by the crime branch, obliquely attempting to link their catch with the Pandya case, CBI has chosen to remain tightlipped about their 'leads' in the case. The attitude is very typical of which does not talk till they have concrete evidence to support the allegations, and right now there seemingly is none.CBI director P C Sharma is expected to arrive in Ahmedabad Wednesday to follow-up on the investigations and discuss the line action. Sources deny any other motive behind Sharma's arrival and attribute it to the fact that athis case being treated on top priority basisa.But police officials also admit that the CBI is anot used to handling such investigations which are localised in naturea. Their biggest disadvantage being the fact that they are on unfamiliar terrain. Second, athe local police also has an advantage as far as the flow of information is concerned, when compared CBI,a says a police officer. Earlier, CBI special director Misra had flown in from New Delhi to oversee the investigations.	0
MYSORE: To tide over water scarcity, the Mysore City Corporation on Wednesday switched on the Emergency Pumping Station at Hongahalli and started lifting 12 mgd of water directly from the Cauvery river bed. Under the supervision of Vani Vilas Water Works executive engineer Thimmegowda and Srirangapatna DySP B.V. Ramachandrappa, lifting of water began after Mescom provided electricity to the Emergency Pumping Station.Thimmegowda said the unit was switched on as water flow in the canal had dipped. The water level at the KRS on Wednesday stood at 72.60 feet with inflow at 152 cusecs, against a maximum of 124.8 feet. The level was 102 feet on the same date last year. Mescom has assured MCC that electricity supply would not be disturbed. DySP Ramachandrappa said farmers, who had staged a protest on Tuesday, are demanding that flow of water into the canal should not be diverted to the Hongahalli Pumping Station and maintained that they have not blocked the flow of water or disturbed pumping of water from Hongahalli. He said they would provide security at the pumping station if the situation warrants it. Meanwhile, the Corporation is making arrangements to call for tenders to take up a Rs 85-lakh project to lift an additional 8 mgd water from the river bed. Thimmegowda said they would call for a tender shortly and maintained that the city would not face a water crisis. During 2000, as the KRS water began dipping, Mandya's farmers had tried to disrupt water distribution from Hongahalli and Belogala pumping stations, saying the water was required for their drinking water needs and crops, leading to tension between them and Mysoreans. Meanwhile, leader of the opposition in the Corporation Narayana has asked the government to intervene and solve the water crisis. The authorities should deal firmly with miscreants who try to disrupt work at Hongahalli and Belogala pumping stations. aPeople of Mysore protested against water release to TN, not only farmers of Mandya,a he said. Mysore is drawing about 5 tmcft water from KRS annually.	1

We are already partners in the coalition in Maharashtra. We welcome Pawar''s proposal for an alliance"", party spokesman S Jaipal Reddy told reporters.Reddy, however, steered clear of the stand taken by Pawar on the foreign origin issue of Congress President Sonia Gandhi saying it was for the NCP leader to ""revise his comments"" in the matter.He said the Congress was for unification of the secular vote in the entire country.Downplaying NCP''s plans to go it alone in Meghalaya, he said Maharashtra and the Northeastern states could not be equated. The Congress and NCP in Meghalaya felt that they would fare better if they contest separately despite being part of the coalition in the state, he said."	1
PATNA: Suspected communist rebels shot and wounded three police officers and stole 15 rifles and ammunition in an attack on a security post in eastern India''s Bihar state on Wednesday, officers said.Local police chief Ravindra Sankaran blamed the People''s War Group for the attack in a village, 125 kilometers (80 miles) northeast of the state capital, Patna.The rebels, also active in five neighbouring states, draw inspiration from Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong and demand sweeping land reforms. More than 6,000 people have been killed since they began fighting two decades ago.Wednesday''s attack came a day before police in Bihar and neighbouring Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh states said they would launch a joint operation against the rebels.On Wednesday, suspected guerrillas also tried to ambush the car of Gaya''s top district administrator. The attackers fled after his police escort opened fire. One officer was wounded, Sankaran said.	1
"LUCKNOW: Union labour minister Sahib Singh Verma on Thursday said that the Centre would bring a bill in Parliament for giving social security to the workers of the unorganised sector. Out of 40 crore work force, only 3 crore were being covered under the social security schemes, said the minister.Speaking at a function on child labours at Ravindralaya, the labour minister said that during the 15-day drive from July 1, the department had identified 67,000 child labours and sent 40,000 of them to schools.He said by 2007, there would not be any child labour in the country.But for complete rehabilitation of child labours, he said, there was need to create an international funding which could be utilised for imparting skill in these children. He said that under the social security schemes, the labours would be given assistance of up to Rs 200 per month in lieu of small contributions. The social security funds, he said, could also be used for providing medical treatment to them. Today, the scheme to identify child labours were being carried in 150 districts in the country but this would be extended to 32 districts.Out of 1 crore child labour in the country, 63,000 had been identified in Uttar Pradesh said, he said. For the implementation of social security schemes, NGO's cooperation could be taken, said the minister, saying that he was aware that many NGOs were not sincere in their work. Some NGOs, he said, were only making profit.Praising the Uttar Pradesh government for ""Jan Shree Beema Yojna"", the labour minister said that this scheme would change the face of children and they would become self-dependent. The minister said that under this, the labour would be asked to contribute Rs 100 in a year and in return would get Rs 100 every month for their two children for a year. This facility, he said, would not be extended to the third child. The minister said that hospitals were being identified where labourers could be given treatment under another scheme launched by the government for them."	0
HUBLI: The announced and unannounced power cuts, frequent technical snags and the ever-busy complaint numbers of the Hubli Electricity Supply Company (Hescom) has left the citizens of the twin cities at the end of their tether. The worst affected are the residents of Deshpandenagar, Visvesvaranagar, Madhura Estate, Ashok Nagar and adjoining areas where there was no power for over 12 hours on Sunday.This was over and above the two hours of loadshedding effected every alternate day. Under these conditions, inverters stop functioning as these cannot be re-charged; fuel of generators gets exhausted and water supply is hit. The residents complained that power cuts are more frequent in the evening or during office hours in the morning. This causes irritation and sleepless nights. People say that repeated efforts to call up the complaint numbers prove futile, as the lines are eternally busy or out of service. Womenfolk of the area have a lot more to complain about. Narrating her tale of woe, Damayanthi, a resident of Dhobighat, said, The power cut which began at 10 am on Sunday due to some technical snag as announced by Hescom was not corrected till late in the evening. This has now become routine here. All eatables, including milk, dairy products, vegetables and fruits, in the refrigerator spoil fast. If I have guests during such times, I feel like running away from home, said a resident. Irked over the apathy of Hescom officials, Vinayak Rathod, another resident of the area, said, It seems the department personnel do not want to listen to complaints. He said that instead of imposing power cuts on residents who pay the electricity bill on time, illegal connections should be checked. The residents should be informed of the cuts at least 48 hours in advance and in case there are some technical snags, methods should be devised so that these are quickly rectified, he said. Similarly, B.N. Patil, a member of the Citizens' Forums said that sleepless nights due to frequent, long and announced power cuts made the life of the residents miserable. He said that under these circumstances when the Hescom could not ensure regular power supply it introduced power cuts. He said that he had sent a representation to the chief engineer of the company in this regard. Meanwhile, various associations in the twin cities have condemned the decision of the state government to impose power cut everyday in places other than Bangalore. Shanu Bhimsen of Hubli-Dharwad Small scale Industries Association said it would have the worst effect on the industry.	0
"GUWAHATI: But for an employee of the Kamakhya temple authorities, one-and-half-year-old Taramai would have been the first human sacrifice in modern days at the Kamakhya temple that has a history of human sacrifices.The little girl was rescued by the devotees and the trust authorities just in time.

"KOLKATA: Tanmay Dhandhania of St Xaviers Collegiate School has visited tribal areas in Ranchi and Jharkhand several times since he was a child. Said the teenager, aI feel tribals have not received their share of love and respect from their urban brethren in India.aDhandhania is not an exception. Like him, there were other youngsters at 'Yuvoday' a"" an annual inter-school competition organised by Youth for Seva, youth wing of city NGO Friends of Tribals Society held recently a"" shared the same feelings.In fact, most of the students from the 11 participating schools at Yuvoday agreed that the cause of tribals was being grossly neglected by the modern urban population.aI think the media has been inefficient in providing an insight about the various tribal groups. Most of us still relate to tribals as a group of people who paint their faces, get drunk and dance happily,a said Sanjita Mazumdar, a Class XI participant from Sri Shikshayatan.The endeavour of Youth for Seva (YFS) was aimed at breaking such myths among youngsters about tribals and creating an awareness about the importance of education in tribal areas. The inter-school event was inaugurated by actor Victor Banerjee at Rotary Sadan and also showcased an exhibition highlighting various activities and programmes of FTS and YFS through photographs and creative charts.Among the other participants were Don Bosco Park Circus, South Point High School, Apeejay, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, Abhinav Bharati, Sree Jain Vidyalaya, La Marteniere for Boys and M.C. Kejriwal Vidyapeeth. The various events revolved around social issues, the inter-school debate topic being 'Education is the route to Emancipation' and poetry writing competition being 'Tribals - Nature's Offsprings'.aWe want students to get involved not only by making them think seriously on the issue but also by encouraging them to take up our 'each one teach one' scheme which sponsors annual education for a tribal child in Rs. 365,a said YFS co-convener Sreemoyee Tarafdar. She also said awareness level among students have improved in the last year and four schools including Sree Jain Vidyalaya, Apeejay and Haryana Vidya Mandir have YFS cells to co-ordinate their working through schools. aWe may have developed in terms of technology but we still have a lot to learn about simplicity and affection from them,a said Dhandhania, who participated at The One Act Play Competition, held during the event."	0

HYDERABAD: The government's move to fix 28 years as upper age limit for the proposed Andhra Pradesh State Development Service (APSDS) is snowballing into a controversy with the unemployed young men saying that they would be deprived of an opportunity to get into the premier service. The unemployed men are worried over the government's plan to reduce the upper age limit for the general candidates for APSDS which is less than the all India services, an IAS aspirant K Dinakar Babu told The Times Of India.He wondered as to how the government could reduce the age which is 30 years for the IAS. Moreover, there was no regular recruitment for Group I and II and other services during the last few years. Hence the government could not fix 28 as the maximum age limit, instead it should give age relaxation for these years, said G Kishore Kumar, who is preparing for the civil services examination. Even the political leaders are not happy over making the knowledge in information technology a must. Congress Forum for Telangana president G Chinna Reddy said that the decision would indeed affect the prospects of students who hail from rural areas. The government should discuss the matter in detail in the assembly before finalising the recruitment procedure, he said. Andhra Pradesh Unemployed Youth Struggle Committee president R Krishnaiah said that the recruitment under the APSDS is aimed at diverting the students' mind. The government should first fill 680 Group I vacancies and 4,800 vacancies in Group II immediately, he said. There is no need to create a new cadre similar to IAS as the existing Group I and other related services and the civil services would be enough for the smooth functioning of the state administration.	1
"NEW DELHI: Vasundhara Vyas'' relief at being back home is palpable in her voice: ""It''s a big relief to be back."" Vasundhara, wife of acting High Commissioner to Pakistan Sudhir Vyas who was expelled, returned to India on Friday night with her 17-year-old son.It''s bad news on the Indo-Pak front, but the families of the Indian diplomatic personnel posted in Pakistan couldn''t be happier to be home again.""Living there was pure hell,"" says the wife of an Indian personnel also among those expelled. ""The children take the dog for a walk, they are followed. You go for a haircut, you''re followed.""Besides the constant shadowing, there was the isolation. Locals don''t socialise with them. In fact, the aggressive surveillance is partly to discourage locals from getting too friendly with the Indians. Cable TV with Indian programmes became a lifeline. And even though there was no immediate sense of physical danger, there was constant tension, says an offficial also among those recently expelled. ""You had to watch what you are doing, where you are going, what you are talking."" It was oppressive for the children too. The Pakistani children are told not to meet Indian children. For their 14-year-old Amit (name changed), anytime friendship threatened to spill into home, the ISI interfered and ensured it ended. ""If my Pakistani friends came over, their parents were harassed.""A posting in Pakistan, then, is not exactly a dream-come-true for Indian diplomats. ""There are people from Pakistan who want to come back here for second postings, but it''s a major task to get an Indian to go there,"" says the official.Things have changed for the worse in the last two decades, agrees former high commissioner G Parth-asarathy. During his second stint many of their friends were even too scared to meet them, he says. ""There was surveillance even earlier, but at least we had friends. Now the social curtsies are no longer there."""	0

Pillai said the BJP, which secured 10 per cent votes in the previous elections but failed to open its account in the state Assembly, was all set to improve its performance with ''growing support'' from various quarters.""Once the third front is formed, political realignments will become effective and many groups, now left suppressed in the ruling and opposition fronts, will turn to us,"" he said.Pillai said BJP''s ties with RSS and VHP were ""very cordial"" in the state and major issues were always discussed by them. ""Our propaganda may differ, but not the approach"".On distribution of tridents by the VHP, he said none had opposed it in Kerala, as the ""people see it as a religious activity. The criticism by some senior Congress leaders on the matter is only to appease the league""."	0
"WASHINGTON: Concerned over fresh revelations that Pakistan continued its covert support of North Korea''s nuclear weapons programme, a prominent US Congressman has said Washington must re-impose sanctions on Islamabad, which continues to have ties with Taliban and terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.Revelations over the last couple of months show that Pakistan has been transferring equipments to support North Korea''s nuclear weapons programme in exchange for ballistic missiles, Democratic Congerssman Frank Pallone said.Pointing out that head of the US State Department''s Bureau of Nonproliferation John S Wolf was reviewing Pakistan''s role in supporting North Korea''s nuclear programme, Pallone said he hoped Wolf will come back with a recommendation that sanctions on Pakistan be re-imposed. ""Though Pakistan has been an ally to the US in our war on terrorism, I support immediate steps by the administration to ban all military sales to Pakistan and to re-impose Symington sanctions on Pakistan for assisting a foreign nuclear weapons programme,"" the New Jersey Congressman wrote recently in a letter to US Secretary of State Colin Powell. Pallone also asked Powell to advise US President George W Bush to publicly acknowledge Washington''s commitment to nonproliferation by re-imposing sanctions on Pakistan.Accusing Pakistan President Musharraf of not cracking down on crossborder terrorism, the co-founder of the Congressional India Caucus said the Bush Administration should review its foreign policy towards Pakistan to prevent further escalation of terrorist activity that could cause a threat to South Asian region and possibly the United States. Pallone, in his letter, cited reports that madrassas continue to exist in Pakistan, educating members of militant Islamic groups and that the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence Agency (ISI) - a group with known ties to both the Taliban and militant groups in Kashmir - was working to regroup and strengthen the Taliban in Pakistan.""Musharraf has not lived up to his promise to ensure that madrassas in his country would be eliminated in an effort to achieve an end to terrorism,"" Pallone said.""Pakistan cannot be exempted of its responsibility in colluding with North Korea over a nuclear weapons programme and in further promulgating terrorism through madrassas and assisting the Taliban,"" he said, adding ""the current situation with Pakistan poses a direct threat to our allies in Asia and to our safety in the US.""Urging the Bush administration to ""do more"" to pressure Pakistan to end ties with the Taliban, he said ""the US must approach the ISI with criticism.""""Given the pattern of Pakistan''s behaviour in the last few months, I urge you to reconsider giving any economic or military assistance to Pakistan,"" he added."	0
"KOLKATA: Concerned at the land use pattern in Darjeeling, where buildings had come up flouting construction specifications, the West Bengal government has entrusted detailed mapping of the hill areas to the Netaji Institute of Asian Studies.West Bengal municipal affairs and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya informed the Assembly on Thursday that the government was worried at the indiscriminate use of land, deforestation and construction of buildings flouting prescribed specification in the Darjeeling hill areas, which might have contributed largely to the massive land loss.Sharing the concern of the The institute, which would map the hill areas of Darjeeling in detail and also demarcate sinking, earthquake and landslide-prone areas, would submit its report to the government.Intervening, Speaker H A Halim shared the concern at the violation of rules in the hill areas of Darjeeling, particularly in construction of buildings, movement of heavy vehicles, land use as well as the rise in population density.He advised the state government to form an expert committee to inquire into the causes of landslides and suggest remedies.The Speaker also advised the state government to evolve a political consensus of the issue as the awareness among the people was more important to ensure that the problem is checked.The speaker said that people were violating norms for construction of buildings in the hill areas of Darjeeling. ""Movement of heavy vehicles, indiscriminate use of lands and the rise in population density has been aggravating the problem,"" he said.Earlier, Kurseong MLA and senior leader of the Gorkha National Liberation Front Santa Chhetri raised the landslide issue during mention hour and alleged that the state government had not sanctioned required funds, as demanded, to meet the situation.She alleged that the state government had not paid due attention to the problem till matters came to such a pass with the recent spate of heavy rains.A recent spate of landslips in the hills had left over 15 people killed and several others injured."	1
"NEW DELHI: Protesting against the government''s inability to convene a meeting of the National Integration Council (NIC) for nearly 10 years, a group of opposition politicians, activists and intellectuals have floated a parallel forum.Announcing the setting up of a People''s Integration Council, its organisers on Tuesday said that it was a civil society initiative to occupy the space vacated by the government.""So many events have taken place calling for introspection and intervention, but the government did not call an NIC meeting even after the Gujarat violence,"" Congress leader Arjun Singh said. He said the move was to bring together diverse views and personalities to deliberate on issues of vital importance to the country.The people''s council will hold its first convention on the state of the nation on February 1-2. Former President K R Narayanan will inaugurate the session while Congress president Sonia Gandhi has been chosen to deliver the keynote speech.Though a predominantly opposition show, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav does not feature on the list of participants. Asked about it, the organisers explained that personalities representing various shades of opinion had been approached to associate with the initiative. ""We even requested a number of BJP and RSS functionaries to participate in the convention. However, their response is not forthcoming,"" said an organiser.CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said that never before had the need for a forum like the NIC been felt so earnestly because of the emergence of divisive politics. ""Instead of strengthening diversity in unity, an attempt is being made to impose uniformity,"" Yechury said.Among the proposed participants are former PM I K Gujral, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, journalists N Ram and Prabhash Joshi, and former Navy chief Vishnu Bhagwat."	1
"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state excise department seized smuggled liquor from a high-profile private party, hosted by Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA), on Sunday night. The party was being held at a farmhouse in Vasant Kunj.The excise department seized bottles of smuggled foreign and Defence liquor from Rishineera farmhouse in Kakori. Farmhouse owner Sunil Kumar Bhagat was arrested and the DDCA authorities were booked for not procuring L-49 licence a"" mandatory for serving liquor at private parties.Officials said many former cricketers and city socialites were present in the party.""Joint secretary of the DDCA Anil Jain had booked the farmhouse for a party. He did so without taking a licence from the excise department. Foreign liquor like Teachers Whisky and French wines, Cuvee Special and Beeje London, were being served at the party. We also seized bottles of Bacardi rum, Smirnoff and Kremlin vodka. They had been bought from the Defence canteen,"" said an official.State excise department suffers huge losses on account of smuggled liquor. Officials said since liquor duty is low in neighbouring states, people often smuggle it into Delhi. Liquor sold at Defence canteen is also served illegally at parties. ""The excise duty on canteen liquor is ten times lower in Defence canteens than that sold in the government vends. The rebate is, however, only for Defence personnel. If civilians buy liquor from these canteens, it is illegal,"" said an official."	0
"LUDHIANA: Commissioner for railway safety (CRS) Bhupinder Singh, who arrived here from Lucknow on Friday morning, began the probe into the Frontier Mail fire accident on Thursday in which 38 people were killed.Singh, who met each of the 14 injured passengers in the Christian Medical College and Dayanand Medical College hospitals here, declined to divulge the information provided by the injured saying that the inquiry was confidential. ""Even though the job is complicated, I will finish the inquiry as early as possible,"" he added. Singh said that in normal course an inquiry takes 10-14 days, but in this case it may take some more time. The probe would be conducted with an open mind and would not be influenced by various theories doing the rounds, he added.However, Singh''s demand for samples of blood and other body parts of the deceased could not be met by the district health authorities as most of the bodies had been burnt beyond recognition. When asked whether this would hinder the probe, Singh said that such tests usually had a 50 per cent chance of providing the cause of fire.Sources said since the bodies had been handed over to the police, the railway investigators would have to go through a long legal procedure to obtain them, which may even anger the relatives of the victims.Twenty-three bodies have already been identified and taken away by the relatives from the mortuary. The CRS, who was scheduled to begin his probe from Sunday, said he would also look into the aspect of sufficiency or otherwise of the railways'' safety measures on the train apart from ascertaining why the fire spread so quickly."	1
"<div class=""section1""><div class=""Normal"">NEW DELHI: In rejecting the US demand for the deployment of Indian troops to Iraq, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has also overruled the publicly expressed view of one of its most important members, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani. <br /><br />Throughout the two month-long debate over the deployment question, most ministers, including Prime Minister Vajpayee, sought refuge in elliptical comments and refused to commit themselves either way.Not so Advani. During his official visit to the US last month, the Dy PM broke ranks and came out strongly in favour of sending Indian troops to assist the US occupation of Iraq. <br /><br />Calling all those opposed to the deployment auninformed'''', Advani told the Aaj Tak channel in an interview from Washington broadcast on June 11 that athe Opposition, without all the facts, gave their one-sided opinion that sending troops to Iraq is wrong... They are entitled to their views, but the Government of India will take its decision based on national interest''''.<br /><br />According to officials familiar with the debate which preceded Monday''s CCS meeting, Advani''s public attack on the critics of deployment did not sit well with other ministers. <br /><br />Officials say the Bush administration had set great store by Advani''s stature within the government and were confident he would prevail. aHe was given prime ministerial treatment in Washington on the assumption that he could swing the decision,a said an official. aBut the fact is that it is Vajpayee who calls the shots.'''' And Vajpayee had reservations about any prospective mission''s legal status. The question of Indian soldiers operating under US command is said to have particularly bothered the PM. <br /><br />Ultimately, the deteriorating security situation inside Iraq, the lack of enthusiasm among Iraq''s neighbours like Iran, Saudi Arabia and even Turkey for any Indian involvement, and the fact that the apolitical consensus was not to send troopsa all led the CCS to say no to the US. <br /><br />Another official told <span style="""" font-style:="""" italic="""">The Times of India</span> that the main stumbling block as far as the CCS was concerned was that the US request for Indian troops adid not fit into any of the known UN formulationsa. The argument that Indian companies would get a share of the reconstruction contracts also did not cut much ice. aOne should not relate this to prospective business deals... India is not a player in international politics to get some contracts.a<br /><br />At the same time, officials acknowledge that it is the intensity of resistance to the US-led occupation which forced India''s hands. <br /><br />Foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal is known to have opposed the US request from the outset but others in the external affairs ministry were keen. But so relentlessly grim was the news from Iraq that by last week, two key MEA officials who had strongly argued in favour of India joining the US occupation were forced to revise their views. <br /><br />The spat between the US army and clandestine Turkish special forces in northern Iraq, which led to 12 Turkish soldiers being aarresteda for two days, further showed that any Indian deployment in the Kurdish areas would be fraught with all kinds of local complications.</div> </div>"	1
"RAJKOT: The Rajkot rural police and Gondal police have found the jeep used by the two angadia firm employees, who were robbed by seven unidentified persons on the Jetpur-Virpur highway on Friday night, from an isolated place in Morbi late on Sunday.The miscreants had robbed cash and jewellery worth Rs 12 lakh, and had fled away with the jeep used by the victims.According to the Rajkot rural police, the jeep was found from street number 8 in the Kayaji plot area. The police have also taken the fingerprints from the door of the jeep. Meanwhile, the police also suspect that the whole incident may have been stagemanaged.They said that even angadia workers sometimes have a hand in such robberies.The two angadia workers, Kiritsinh and Khumansinh, told the police that they had seen a jeep following them right from Dhoraji, and the incident took place after they had covered a distance of about 40 km on the Jetpur-Virpur highway. Surprisingly, both of them had mobile phones, but still they did not inform either the police or the owners about an imminent danger. The police were investigating this angle also.Besides, the police were also perplexed by the statement given by the two workers. According to the statement, the miscreants had told Khumansinh,""Tum bhi Rajput, hum bhi Rajput. Hum tumhe marenge nahi, tumhe sirf ija karenge (You are a Rajput and so are we. We won''t kill you, but will only injure you).""But what has raised the suspicion of the police about some foul play in the entire incident is that how could have the robbers known that Khumansinh was a Rajput."	0

"Children, with gift of the gab, enthusiastically voiced their opinions at the NIE, The Times of India Young Reporter's Press Conference at the FICCI auditorium on February 6. With a fire in their bellies, and an immeasurable amount of fortitude to change the tides of time, the Young Reporters interacted with an eminent panel of judges, Dr Dileep Padgaonkar, Sabina Sehgal Saikia (Editor, Delhi Times) and Punit Jain (AGM RMD).Dr Padgaonkar inspired the students and all present with his candid, awe inspiring comments, like 'each generation creates its own Times of India'.

In an endeavour to quench their undying thirst for answers, the Young Reporters interacted vociferously with the panel of judges. This not only satiated them intellectually but also fetched them prizes for the best questions. One of the prize winning questions was by Piyush Gupta of Ravindra Public School, who wanted to know why the Indian festivals like Basant Panchami do not get as much coverage as Valentine's day. Akash Aggarwal of New Era Public School enquired about how far it is the done thing for sportsmen to endorse advertisements. Mallika of DPS Noida gave a clarion call to the evil of eve teasing and desired to know what is really the ultimate solution. The panel fielded the questions bravely and reiterated the role of pen in shaping the society. At this event, Young Reporters were also felicitated for their contribution in The Times Offspring. Ten best contributions, carefully handpicked by Dr Padgaonkar, received the prestigious 'The Times Offspring Scholarships' of Rs 1000 each and a citation. The scholarship recipients honoured for the year 2001-02 were Manik Bhargava, VIII-B, Happy School, Daryaganj, Yashika, VI-A, Andhra Education Society, Janakpuri, Aastha Mittal, Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, Bina Emanuel, XI-C, St Francis De Sales, Khushboo Chugh, X-B, Doon Public School, Deepa Chauhan, XII, Gyan Mandir Public School, Rishabh Bhandari, XI-B, Blue Bells School, Shreya Talwar, IX-B, Army Public School, Noida, Swati Soman, VI-A, Vidya Bharti School Rohini and Atul Jain, XII-A, Mahavir Sr Model School.

The five best answers won not only a prize, but were also extended a chance to be a reporter for a day with the Delhi Times by Sabina Sehgal. The lucky five were Anjali Subramanian, XI-B, Mater Dei School, Monoj Kumar, X, M R Vivekanand Model School, Sneha Banerjee, XI, Raisina Bengali School Mandir Marg, Manavi Suneja, XI, Gyan Bharti School and Deepika Kaur, XI-C, N P Bengali Girls Sr Sec School. Earlier this year, NIE in association with the National Commission on Population had organized a population quiz in The Times Offspring. The winners of the quiz were also awarded on this very day by Dr Dileep Padgaonkar. An on-the-spot quiz competition on the 'The Times of India' resulted in an overwhelming response. The children received exciting on-the-spot prizes, too. The one and a half-hour grilling, intense interactive session concluded with Dr Padgaonkar bouncing one question on to the NIEians as to why the girls won more prizes than the boys. A prompt answer came from Uttkarsh Modi of Vishwa Bharati Public School, Dwarka who endorsed Dr Padgaonkar's view itself - ""Sir, as you had opined earlier, the times have changed, and so have we. Women are no longer confined to the four walls of the house. Today, they are not just equal to men, but are one step ahead of them."" Well answered! The hall reverberated with a loud applause as Dr Padgaonkar presented him with a special prize. Seeing the enthusiasm and concern displayed by our Young Reporters, one can be sure that the future of journalism, and of the society is in good hands. (Medianet promo)"	0
"BHOPAL: Every day at 4 o''clock in the morning, Asha, 28, and her husband Rajkumar, 30, walk four km on foot from Itwara to reach their ''dera'' or workplace. Their destination: Chandwara, the old city of the Nawabs, where dry latrines need to be cleaned.Asha knocks on the tin sheet that guards the rear of the latrine. On getting no response, she lifts the tin sheet and collects the day-old human excreta in a bamboo basket.The waste is dumped in a drain 2 km away. To clean 40 houses here, she makes around six trips to the drain with the basket on her head.""It''s a flat rate of Rs 10 per month per adult,"" said Rajkumar. ""If a family of six adults and two children use the dry toilet, we get Rs 60 per month for the adults. For the children, the rate is - one roti per child per day. But the rotis are mostly leftovers and stale.""About 5,000 Dalit families in Bhopal eke out a living cleaning dry toilets. This in a state which has become the hub of Dalit sloganeering in the past year-and-a-half. Incidentally, in a situation where both the BJP and the chief minister are eyeing the Dalit votebank, CM Digvijay Singh was not permitted to go to Vancouver for a Dalit conference. The BJP is setting the stage to come out with its Dalit agenda.Although both parties are fighting for the significant 36 per cent of the Dalit votebank, neither has taken note of the fact that these ''valmikis'' or ''mehtars'' continue their dehumanising work hardly five km from the chief minister''s official residence.The National Human Development Report 2001 says 7.87 per cent households in MP have access to flush toilets as against 90.14 per cent in Karnataka, 58.14 per cent in Bihar and 9.46 per cent in Orissa.""Why just private cleaners, there are 200 Dalits working with the city municipal corporation for the same purpose,"" said Vijay Shravan, president M P Sakal Valmiki Panchayat, a Dalit NGO. ""The corporation doesn''t give these employees gloves or masks. While others clean dry toilets, the muck is dumped in trolleys manned by the corporation''s Dalit employees.""""The chief minister says he has distributed land to 3.5 lakh Dalits. My NGO approached the state several times so the contracts to clean medical and human waste may be given to a Dalit organisation. But the government has continued to give it to a Brahmin."""	1
BELLARY: Nine cases of polio have been reported from North Karnataka. The latest case is that of an 18-month-old boy Basavaraj from Upparahalli village in Hospet taluk. He was infected in May.

"HAJIPUR: In a belated move, joint secretary of the personnel and administrative reforms department Harun Rashid, has sought all relevant papers of the case related to the alleged huge bungling in toll collection of Mahatma Gandhi Setu by a former executive engineer of the PWD, Rashid Ahmad Khan, from the complainant, Chandrashekhar Patel. Incidentally, Patel happens to be the spokesperson of the state Yuva JD(U).The joint secretary has in a letter asked Patel to submit all proofs of alleged bungling and the affidavit for official perusal and subsequent action. Patel had also filed a PIL in this connection in the high court in 1994.Talking to Times News Network, Patel said that a complaint letter was sent by him to the personnel and administrative reforms department along with the order of the high court for action against Khan.Khan is now the district magistrate of Vaishali.""Following the PIL, the high court had asked the state government to inquire into the alleged bungling. But the state government ignored the HC order and even promoted the then executive engineer Khan to the IAS rank,"" said Patel.Patel is also to file a writ in the high court if the state government fails to take appropriate action.The district magistrate, Rashid Ahmad Khan, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts."	0
"NEW DELHI: There is unlikely to be any blame-fixing in the Congress for its Gujarat debacle. Party chief Sonia Gandhi''s recent high-spirited reaction, despite ""disappointment"" at the results, indicates that no heads are going to roll. That being the mood, Gujarat PCC chief Shankersinh Vaghela''s resignation is unlikely to be accepted, senior party members say.Still shell-shocked after the poll debacle in Gujarat, the Congress is not looking for scapegoats unlike earlier times when heads used to roll after it lost an election.But ""this is not Sonia Gandhi''s style"", party insiders insist. As a result, so far, the defeat has not generated factional fighting.An internal assessment is on, not so much for fixing responsibility, but for future strategy, sources say. But there is also criticism, made privately, that the assessment is being conducted mainly by those who were responsible for what happened. ""So, where is the blame-fixing?"" a party functionary asked.""We are all responsible for the defeat,"" party general secretary Oscar Fernandes told Times News Network, taking a holistic view that reflects the thinking of the top leadership.""We could not have won because we were fighting a demon. When mass became a mob, we could not take it on. They (BJP and the Sangh Parivar) created a communal divide and sustained it,"" Fernandes alleged.There is a good deal of wisdom by hindsight on Gujarat among the Congress leaders. But in fairness to the party, no senior Congress leader, in private, was willing to give a winning chance to the party even when the campaign was on. Taking a public posture was a different matter though. The Congress was then hoping that it would improve its tally, which it did not. But the few who thought it could win later blamed the ""media-hype"" for their eroneous assessment.""We were able to arrest the spread of the communal divide. It was restricted to Ahmedabad and Central Gujarat,"" Fernandes argued. Citing a five per cent increase in the Congress vote, he admitted: ""The results were not commensurate with our effort.""Senior party leader Devendra Nath Dwivedi said the BJP tally too went up by five per cent and the party cornered a two-thirds majority. But he argued: ""Statistics do not win elections, situations do. After the Godhra incident and the subsequent violence, there was no way we could have stopped the BJP''s march to victory. Not after the Congress, or anybody opposing the BJP, was clubbed with the leader of a hostile neighbour."""	1

SURAT: Three persons were injured in a shooting incident at Amidhara Choksi Wadi near Rander here on Thursday afternoon. The incident is believed to be the result of a long-pending dispute over some land deal between two groups. According to police, three unidentified persons fired at one Naresh Mafta injuring his hand and shoulder. Two others, Mustafa and Nimesh, standing nearby also received bullet injuries in the incident.Deputy commissioner of police (west) K L N Rao told TNN that all the three persons were rushed to a nearby hospital. However, no one had suffered any serious injury. Preliminary investigations revealed that the motive behind the incident could be some old enmity between the two groups over some land deals in Bhestan village. The assailants, who came on a motorcycle, are absconding. Combing operations have been launched to track them down, Rao said. Interestingly, Nafta was said to be involved in a similar attack on the same group sometime ago. Police are investigating further.	1

VYARA (Surat): Though it was not a direct reference to the Best Bakery case and the controversy surrounding the acquittal of all the accused in the case, Chief Minister Narendra Modi was sarcastic enough to urge the mass to screen out all those questioning the judicial system and even termed these activities as media-driven.While addressing a gathering after the inaugural function of a new court building at Vyara in Surat on Saturday, the chief minister said that those targeting the judiciary were posing threats to the society and for vested interests, some were bent on putting a question mark on the accountability of the entire judicial system.Terming it as a dangerous trend creeping into the social system, he said that those behind it should be exposed and externed from the society.Earlier, the two-storeyed new court building, built at cost of Rs 1.8 crore, was inaugurated by Acting Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court J N Bhatt.

"GAYA: The state energy minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan has offered conditional job guarantee to the Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) workers.Referring to the apprehension of retrenchment of workers and privatisation of the BSEB, the minister said that the apprehensions were misplaced and not a single board workers would lose their jobs if the workers delivered results.  ""Give me work guarantee and I will give you job guarantee"", he said. Khan was inaugurating the sixth state convention of the Bihar Bijli Mazdoor Union in Gaya on Saturday evening.Allaying the fears of the BSEB workers, the minister said that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Union government has been signed for power sector reforms which do not necessarily mean privatisation.The minister also expressed serious dissatisfaction with the performance of the electricity board and said that a section of the board employees were hand in glove with the power thieves. For survival, the Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) will have to change its work culture and deliver results. He also chided the Bihar State Electricity Board officials for treating senior bureaucrats, politicians and other privileged section of the society as sacred cows and provide free power to this section. For more than a decade billing has not been done of the power consumed by these sections, revealed the minister.Presenting a very dismal electricity scenario of the state, the energy minister said that as against a monthly establishment cost of Rs 115 crore, the revenue generation was no more than Rs 65 crore. Moreover, as against a peak hour requirement of 900 MW of power, the Barauni and Kanti units were producing not more than 120 MW, which was less than 30 per cent of the installed capacity of 400 MWs.Power worth Rs 8 crore was being supplied to the Magadh area and the establishment cost of the region was about Rs 3.5 crore per month, which meant that the total cost of power in the region comes to Rs 11.5 crore per month. As against this, the monthly revenue collection of the Magadh area board was no more than Rs 4.5 crore which meant a recurring loss of Rs 7 crore per month in the region.The state energy minister also said that though revenue collection has gone up from Rs 45 crore per month to Rs 65 crore per month during the last two years, much needs to be done to cover the wide gap between the monthly revenue and expenditure of the Bihar State Electricity Board. The energy minister said that though privatisation of the electricity board in Bihar was not on the agenda of the state government, the trifurcation of the Bihar State Electricity Board into three independent profit centres dealing with generation, transmission and distribution had become inevitable. Entry of private sector through global tenders for future power plants can also not be ruled out.The state law and energy minister also took a dig at the Union government and said that nowhere else in the world, the disinvestment ministry exist and the minister Arun Shourie was being rewarded with plum additional portfolios for what he alleged was the ''sale of national assets''.Those present on the occasion included the junior minister for excise in the Rashtriya Janata Dal ministry, Surindra Prasad Yadav, and the Magadh area board general manager Nagendra Singh."	1
"PATNA: The appointment of Ram Jatan Sinha as the new BPCC chief has been hailed by party leaders.According to Congress sources, Sinha is expected back from Delhi on Friday. Sadaquat Ashram will organise a function to felicitate him. Sinha, said the party leaders, will also hold talks with AICC president Sonia Gandhi on the organisational polls scheduled to be held soon.The change of guard is being widely viewed as 'a step towards the direction of snapping ties with the RJD' a demand which has been repeatedly made by majority of Congress leaders here.""None of the Congress ministers inform the district chiefs about their arrival and visit to respective districts,"" said a senior Congress leader expressing hope that Sinha would be able to bring more interaction between the ministers and party workers.The vice president of the state Congress, Padmasha Jha, has expressed hope that the upper caste votes, which had eluded the Congress in recent years, will return to the party fold under Sinha. She said the upper castes had been feeling neglected by the present RJD government and due to the alliance they remained out of the party fold. BPCC secretary Srikant Satyadarshi and former MLA Raj Rajendra Pratap Dev have also greeted this move and said he can revitalise the party.Former MP Mahendra Mohan Mishra said Sinha represented both the young and as well as old Congressmen.

"At midnight on Thursday, a fleeting thought: Thank God nothing happened. The Godhra anniversary had passed peacefully, as indeed had September 11 and December 13 earlier.There is something ominous about disaster-day anniversaries. And it is not so much do with the stellar arrangement in the heavens above as the fact that it may tickle the sense of drama in mischief makers.The threat seemed even more real on the Godhra anniversary as communal passions take but a chance word to ignite and the Ayodhya issue has been building up in almost the same manner as it did this time last year.Barely three days before the Godhra anniversary, thousands of sadhus picnicked outside Parliament while their leaders declared war on ""secularists"", on truculent Muslims refusing to budge on the Ayodhya issue, on just about anyone who came in the way of constructing the Ram temple. The sadhus brandished trishuls and lathis in approval, that is when they were not posing for the cameras or fighting over the right to sit on one of the limited chairs available.The head of the Ramjanmbhoomi Nyas Ramchandra Paramhans made his annual sucide threat if construction did not begin, religous heads vowed to damn naysayers to eternal darkness and they all vowed to be back on March 27, by which time their demands should have been met. In short, a good time was had by all.It happened last year, same time, same place before the macabre action shifted to Gujarat. It was election time in Uttar Pradesh then. This time it was Himachal Pradesh. The Nyas has announced construction of the temple in the next one-and-a half-years. Does not need Einstein to tell me it will be time for the Lok Sabha elections.Every year on December 6, the Babri mosque demolition anniversary, the nation is wired up as security goes on high alert expecting communal violence. If the people are too caught up in the daily grind to remember, their leaders make it a point to remind them, stalling Parliament proceedings, sitting on a dharna with ""Shame! Shame!"" placards or shouting Jai Shri Ram depending on which side you are.For a generation that was just out of its teens, the Babri masjid demolition on December 6 1992 and its aftermath was an overwhelming experience. No one was untouched, everyone had an opinion. On DTC buses, at tea-stalls, in college canteens there were hot debates as a different kind of political consciousness dawned. It was disturbing, even exciting as basic questions were raised.A decade later, there are no answers. And there are unlikely to be any till there are elections to be won. There is, however, the ritualistic blame game every time political leaders meet in Parliament. This time Lok Sabha members sat to debate the worn-out issue for the umpteenth time exactly a year after 56 kar sevaks were burnt alive in a compartment of the Sabarmati Express. For the umpteenth time again there was no meeting point and Opposition members duly walked out at the end of nine hours no closer to a solution.This time Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s election campaign utterances in Himachal, Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani''s assurances to partymen and the Centre''s move to seek an early verdict in the Supreme Court triggered the debate. But for anyone who ambled in to catch the middle of a speech from either side it was de javu.The arguments are the same - the Opposition benches demand that the VHP and other radicals in the sangh Parivar be banned or arrested, the ""secular"" NDA allies like the Telugu Desam Party and now the Bahujan Samaj Party try to shrink in their seats, using bravado to mask the squirming when compelled to speak and the BJP and Shiv Sena take up the temple chant. Then, a BJP minister puts the allies out of their misery by declaring that there shall be no deviation from the NDA agenda. This time Law Minister Arun Jaitley did the honours.In the end, tired Parliamentarians troop out in the middle of the night handing out sound bytes to equally tired journalists compelled to report the last of it. Till the next time."	1

NEW DELHI: A Class X student of Army Public School (APS), Dhaula Kuan, was allegedly kidnapped on Saturday by the driver and conductor of a private RTV in which she used to go to school.According to the police, the girl was released later in the day in the Delhi Cantonment area. The girl's father, an Army personnel in the Defence Services Corps, got a case registered at the Delhi Cantonment police station.The driver, Vikram Singh, and conductor, Rajender Chawla, were arrested on Monday evening.The police have ruled out any sexual violence after medical examination of the girl.The girl lives with her family in Railway Colony, Nangal Raya, and has been using the RTV for over three months. Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Tajinder Luthra said: ''The 17-year-old girl, who came with her father to register the complaint, said the same driver and conductor had also tried to outrage her modesty on May 19. The accused took her to a park in Delhi Cantonment. She raised an alarm and managed to escape.''The girl told the police that on Saturday morning the accused had taken her up to the gate of her school. But instead of letting her get down there, they took her to a flat in Sarojini Nagar where she was kept confined for two hours. ''The two kept on discussing whether to kill me or release me,'' she told the police.After the girl was released, the abductors reportedly threatened her against informing the police. The accused did not demand any ransom and the family ruled out personal enmity.The girl told the police that she had not reported the earlier attempt at molesting her due to threats from the accused. The police is ascertaining the girl's version and is also investigating the May 19 incident.APS principal Lieutenant-Colonel P C Adi said: ''Appropriate action is being taken by the local police as the bus is operated privately through a civil contractor.''The police, meanwhile, registered a case against the accused under sections pertaining to wrongful restraint, illegal confinement, criminal intimidation and trying to outrage a girl's modesty, Luthra said.	1
DHANTALA, Nadia: There are striking similarities between the Dhantala and Ghoksadanga incidents. In both cases, women from CPM supporters' families were raped, but the party disowned them. CPM leaders and supporters were arrested or wanted. aLike 'bourgeois' parties, feuds over crumbs of power have led to the crimes against women,'' observed activist Krishna Banerjee.Columnist Saswati Ghosh was disturbed by the fact that CPM leaders were questioning the character of the Ghoksadanga victim, aas if rape can be condoned if she is a 'fallen' woman''.At Dhantala, educated middle class leaders were involved. CPM zonal committee leader Subal Bagchi was arrested as the mastermind.The police and CPM leaders said that he wanted to settle scores with local party committee secretary Sanat Dhali. Both are science teachers. Affluent CPM panchayat member Shahidul Karigar has been held for engaging criminals on behest of Bagchi. Dhali's wife Kalpana, a CPM panchayat member, said that the tussle began when Dhali replaced Bagchi as the LCS and Kalpana took her husband's place in the panchayat.aBoth Bagchi and my husband wanted to be MLA. But I never thought Bagchi would plan such a revenge. My daughter was his student. He attended her marriage and visited us after the incident,a recalled Kalpana. CPM MLA Asim Bala admitted of inner-party feuds.aI did not want to contest but the party insisted. Bagchi and Dhali assured me that they would work together,'' he said. He denied having inaugurated or visited the madrassah where some victims were allegedly assaulted. Bagchi's followers complained that he was framed.Even Bala said that Bagchi was known to ahelp the poora. A CPM minister from the district confirmed that Bagchi had displeased police and party bosses by organising a demonstration on February 6. He had an altercation with the SP after making some allegedly communal comments.	1

"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has asserted his government was willing to reform madarasa education if there was a ""consensus"" within the Muslim community even as the Islamic Council of India (ICI) said the step was necessary to dispel certain ""misleading propaganda"" about these theological schools.In a message to ICI Chairman Qari Mian Mazhari in connection with a national symposium of representatives of madarasas on Sunday, Vajpayee asked Islamic leaders to ""evolve a consensus on introducing science, computer education, English and vocational training as part of the curriculum"".""Madarasas have produced many freedom fighters and makes one a good human being but it requires modern education to enable the students to play active part in nation''s progress and development,"" he said in the message.He said the NDA government was duty bound to ensure the educational and economical upliftment of the minority community.Condemning attempts to portray madarasas as the ""breeding grounds of anti-national activities"" and other ""misleading propaganda"", speakers at the symposium asked the Centre and state governments not to discriminate these schools in matters of extending various assistance and introduction of schemes.""In the absence of modern reforms and because of lack of interest to impart them to theological institutions, large section of students always remain exposed to the type of education not relevant today,"" Mazhari said inaugurating the meet. Mazhari said a number of modernisation schemes including introduction of scientific subjects and computer education, and benefits like aid, scholarships and stipends, though announced by the Government, have not been implemented by many states.Head of Centre for Al Sunnah Culture Abu Baker Qadri called for frequent interaction between the HRD ministry and Muslim educational boards so that a number of problems faced by the community on the education front may be addressed.Echoing Mazhari''s views, Qadri said the Muslim community can avail the benefits of various central and state sponsored schemes only if there was a separate body to oversee its implementation.Islamic scholar Haleem Khan said a number of madarasas were closing down across the country owing to lack of funds and as per their latest figures out of three crore Muslim children aged between 6 and 14, 40 per cent were illiterate.Chairman of National Commission of Minorities Trilochan Singh assured the Muslim leaders that the forum will take all steps to remove the hurdles in implementation of various schemes aimed at the modernisation and development of madarasas."	0

"AHMEDABAD: Three of the four persons, who deposed before the Nanavati-Shah Commission probing last year''s communal riots here on Wednesday, spoke of police inaction as they recounted the days of terror in Ahmedabad when the state was ripped apart by widespread communal violence. The commission, probing the violence, began this crucial phase of hearings on Wednesday to record evidence in cases other than the Naroda-Patia and Gulbarg Society massacres which will be heard later.The commission, comprising Justice (retd) GT Nanavati and Justice (retd) KG Shah, had invited people from the Ellisbridge and Satellite police station areas to depose before it. The hearing, that will go on till July 22, are being held at the commission''s office in Shahibaug. Those who deposed before the court on Wednesday included an advocate from Satellite, Triveni Sharma, who was a witness to mob frenzy near Shivranjani char rasta on February 28, 2002. She said she was disturbed by the sight of an irate mob trying to set a bus on fire. ""I was not carrying my mobile phone but I approached a person with one and asked him to call the police for help, who arrived later,"" Sharma added. Advocate Amrish Patel told the commission during his deposition that the ""police had been a mute spectator on February 28, 2002, as Hindu mobs,wearing saffron bandanas, were on a rampage."" ""Even I was stopped on my way by the mob. The police never came forward to help,"" Patel said. He also said that he was witness to the burning of a supermarket and a restaurant in presence of the police. The third witness to depose before the commission was restaurateur Mulji Solanki who lost four of his properties after mobs ransacked and torched them in Satellite and Ambawadi areas of the city in the first two days of the communal riots. Solanki told the commission that four of his restaurants a"" Abhilasha, Topaz, Kabir and Tasty a"" were co-owned by him and four of his Muslim partners and were targeted because of their Muslim ownership as no other restaurant in the area was torched. He said police constables were present when mobs set Tasty restaurant ablaze, situated very close to the Chief Justice''s bungalow and opposite a police post, on fire. He ruled out business rivalry as the motive behind this act. Solanki added that miscreants possibly had specific information about the Muslim links of the restaurants as there were no means to identify the ownership from the outer appearance of the establishments. He also said about 10 Muslims, trapped inside one of the restaurants, were rescued by him, but regretted the death of three others. When advocate Mukul Sinha, who cross-examined Solanki, asked if either of the restaurants had appeared to be run by Muslims from its outer appearance, Solanki said it was not possible and that ""that could be known only if such specific information was sought."" The fourth person to depose was the deputy sarpanch of Vastrapur panchayat, Bharat Chandulal Prajapati, who said that there was no law and order problem in the area. Advocate Arvind Pandya appeared as special counsel for the Gujarat government while advocate Nigam Shukla was the government counsel. The commission on Thursday will be hearing depositions in connection with incidents which took place in Vejalpur area during the riots."	1
CHANDIGARH: Almost threatening Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh of serious consequences for following politics of revenge, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu said that they (party and the union government) were keenly observing the situation.He added that things would not be allowed to continue like this for long. Launching a frontal attack on the Punjab government, Naidu said that the government was busy in its one point programme of ''Badla (revenge), Badli (transfers) and Badal (attacking predecessor Parkash Singh Badal)a.Naidu said that the government was ''harassing, humiliating and intimidating'' the opposition.He was speaking here after the inauguration of the BJP's office building on Sunday. Referring to Amarinder's assertion that the law would take its own course in case of Akali ministers, especially Badal, Naidu said that the law would also take its course in Amarinder's case. He said that he too would have to pay for misusing his authority. ''For the last one year, Amarinder has been threatening to arrest Badal,'' said Naidu while questioning the propriety of such warnings. He, however, added in a lighter vein that even this one point agenda of Amarinder had remained unaccomplished.He also ridiculed Amarinder's threat to file a defamation suit against BJP leaders Vijay Kumar Malhotra and Madan Lal Khurana saying that the BJP would welcome it. ''It's good, if he dares to file a case against them,'' he quipped. Nadiu said the Congress was fast losing its popularity in Punjab for not honouring its electoral promises. ''The Congress promised to continue free power to farmers in Punjab but after elections it withdrew it,'' said Naidu while accusing the party of misleading the people.BJP president Venkaiah Naidu has ruled out the preponement of the Lok Sabha polls scheduled for September-October 2004. He was speaking on the sidelines of a training camp for party legislators from north eastern states on the concluding day in Chandigarh on Sunday.	1
HOWRAH: The Howrah station neighbourhood has become a hub for the sale of illegal country and foreign liquor. The activity extends to the jetties opposite the station. And this is happening right under the nose of the GRP, RPF and the excise department. Selling and consuming of liquor take place openly and even in during the day. There is an unlicensed liquor shop in the Third Jetty right opposite the GRP's office.There are more that 20 such vendors operating in the area. aOfficials of the GRP and the RPF have turned a blind eye to the flourishing racket. They are bribed regularly by the vendors,a alleged secretary of the Mutia Mazdoor union Buddhadev Mitra. He also alleged that there is a thriving satta operating in the area which the authorities have chosen to ignore. The liquor racket has meant that after 8 pm the vicinity of the station becomes unsafe. The operations of the hooch vendors work are on in full swing then and they are joined by sex workers who frequent the place in search of clients. Drunken brawls and eveteasing are common making the place dangerous for commuters. aIf I come back home alone at night, I try to avoid this stretch. The place has become a den anti-socialsa, said Ruma Sanyal, who is a daily commuter. Officials of GRP and the RPF admitted hat a liquor racket flourishing in the area. RPF officials said they conducted raids whenever they got wind of such activities. aWe confiscated a good amount of hooch from a vendor but man managed to flee,a said senior commandant S.C Sahu after a recent raid. aWe conduct regular raids that is not enough.We need the cooperation of the RPF and the excise officials. A combined effort required to control the liquor dens,a said a senior GRP official. When a vendor opposite the GRP's office was pointed out, he showed some confiscated liquor and they had conducted a raid the earlier day. He also summoned his juniors to conduct another raid. the impact of these raids is yet be seen.	0
LUCKNOW: Was the action initiated against the top CB-CID official in Madhumita murder case a mere eyewash to pave the way for some junior officers in the state to make it to the chair of the state police chief? Even as the state police top brass continued to insist that DGP Hakam Singh was very much in the saddle, rumours about the search for his predecessor continued to haunt the UP police. And to add to the crisis is the suspension of CB-CID chief Mahendra Lalka being painted as part of a strategy to pave the way for a junior officer to come into the race for the post of DG Police. Though officially it could not be confirmed if Hakam Singh had submitted any written application seeking withdrawal from the post, his illness has been a matter of discussion among the IPS cadre in the state as he has to be frequently admitted to the SGPGIMS for treatment of kidney problem. If the grapevine is to be believed, an upright officer who had earlier declined to take charge of DG Police has now given his consent for the post and is likely to be the new incumbent. Another theory afloat is that some top bureaucrats are interested in awarding promotions to two of their blue-eyed officers who may jump one post to land as contender for the chair of the state police chief. One of them is a Punjabi and another South Indian. That DG CB-CID was suspended to accommodate one of these officers in his place later on and then absorb the other contender by upgrading the post where he is likely to be transferred within a day or two is said to be the strategy. But with most of the officials staying tightlipped over the issue, it is more of a conjecture and less of reasoning insist senior IPS officers adding that the unpredictable manner in which the chief minister Mayawati is known to move very often, can lead to anything anytime. So is the hunt on for a new DGP, is the prime question for now.	0

AHMEDABAD: Film actress Shilpa Shetty's father, Surendra Shetty, has acknowledged during his interrogation, done by the Surat police in the Prafful Sarees extortion case, that he first contacted BJP MLA Purushottam Solanki and his brother Hirabhai Solanki to recover the dues for the ad film in which Shilpa had featured.Sources in the police here disclosed that Surendra Shetty, who was interrogated on Friday in Surat, stated that he had met Purushottam Solanki at a wedding ceremony in Mumbai and sought his intervention to put pressure on Prafull Sarees owner Pankaj Aggarwal, who was allegedly holding back the payment.Police sources said that Solanki, a BJP strongman from Bhavnagar who is also allegedly linked to the mafia in Mumbai, initially assured Shetty that he would do something in the matter.aShetty has claimed that after five or six visits to Solanki, the latter told him that he won't be able to help him in the mattera, sources said.The negotiations with Aggarwal were said to have been done by Hirabhai. Police officials said it was only after Solanki, a former BJP minister and also a TADA detainee, failed to deliver the goods that Shetty got in touch with the Malaysia-based don Fazl-ur-Rehman whose associates allegedly made extortion calls to Aggarwal.Said a senior police official, aShetty established contacts with Solanki through his driver, Dilip, who has worked with him for over 30 years.aApparently, Dilip who is 'well-connected' in Mumbai first got him introduced to Solanki through an NCP worker, but when this did not work out, he was put to Uday Shetty alias Ashraf and Dinesh, both associates of Fazlur-Rehman.Talking to TNN, Shetty, however, denied news reports that he had established contacts with Rehman's associates to recover the money.aI had talked to them over phone because they posed as men of Pankaj Aggarwal,a Shetty said before leaving for Mumbai on Saturday. Shetty's lawyer S V Raju also termed the reports as false and said, aMy client never admitted at any time during the interrogation or to any other person that he had talked to the mafia.a	0
"NEW DELHI: Apparently sobered by beefed up police presence, Shiv Sena activists, who had threatened to disrupt Valentine Day celebrations in the capital, on Friday held peaceful demonstrations outside shops and food chains against promotion of what they called ""a vulgar western concept.""The activists, party''s Delhi unit Chief Jai Bhagwan Goyal, staged demonstrations carrying placards and shouting anti-Valentine''s Day slogans outside shops in Kamala Market, Connaught Place and Ansal Plaza in South Delhi in the presence of security personnel, deployed to prevent any untoward incident.Party workers had on Thursday vandalised a shop in East Delhi as a ""warning"" to the youngsters.Lashing out against media and multinationals for ""promoting and sustaining Western values at the cost of Indian Culture and ethos"", Goyal asked the government to wake up from its slumber and do something to check the Valentine day ''menace''.""Parents must stop their children from going out on this day so that they do not fall prey to lust at young age and develop into healthy and productive individuals,"" Goyal said while addressing the protesters.Criticising the media for its lopsided coverage of Indian festivals like Holi, Diwali or Dusshera and giving undue weightage to such ""foreign"" festivals like Valentine''s Day, Goel said ""the media must correct its approach"" to save Indian values.""Love is a union of souls and not bodies. These imported festivals will only highlight the flesh and materialism which derogates the whole concept of love,"" he said."	1
"CHIKMAGALUR: Not an inch of land from Karnataka will be given to anybody, said Karnataka Chief Minister S M Krishna here on Sunday. On the occasion of Taralabalu Hunnime valedictory function, the CM criticised the Maharashtra government which has taken the decision to move the Supreme Court to settle the border dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra.

"KOLKATA: The last rays of the Chaitra sun was particularly unkind to the city on Sunday as temperatures soared to 37 degrees Celsius by early afternoon and the city wore a deserted look with everyone but anti-war protesters deciding to stay indoors.Even the National Football League match between local giants East Bengal and Indian Bank at the Salt Lake Stadium was postponed by two hours as a result of the stifling heat.Foreign tourists, with little time on hands, were the worst sufferers. At around 3 pm four young French women were seen trying to figure out how to operate a tube well. ""It is so humid. Walking from the Indian Museum to our hotel in Sudder Street seems like a marathon through the desert,"" said Philippine.Not surprisingly the pubs around Park Street and Esplanade were full, particularly those that advertised the fact that they had ''AC bars''.

"SRINAGAR: A lone BSP member in Jammu and Kashmir state legislative assembly Sardar Manjit Singh on Wednesday asked for ownership rights of displaced people in Pakistan occupied Kashmir during 1965 and 1971 wars.Raising a query during question hour in the state assembly, Manjit Singh informed the House that the people displaced during the two wars have been settled along Indo-Pak border thereby adding to their sufferings due to intermittent firing on the borders.Relying to the question, State Revenue Minister Hakeem Mohammad Yasin quoting government orders said the displaced persons have been given proprietary rights over the land they occupy on this side of the state.The minister even disagreed with the point that the displaced persons have been settled on the border. The government is in the process of identifying such persons whose proprietary rights have not been granted, he said. On a similar issue, Romesh Chander Sharma, Congress MLA asked the minister in charge whether the government was committed to shifting the people living within the 5-km range of the line of control (LoC) and settle them at safer places.Denying any such proposal, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad, who also holds the home portfolio, said, ""There is no proposal to settle the border people falling within 5-km range to safer places.""However, he said, the proposal for rehabilitation of border migrants residing on zero line of Tehsil Akhnoor and Ballakote in Jammu is under consideration."	0
NEW DELHI: Several localities in west Delhi are facing problem of garbage accumulation as private trucks have stopped lifting garbage. Raja Garden, Basai Darapur, Raghubir Nagar, Subhash Nagar and Kirti Nagar are some of the affected colonies. According to the local councillor and leader of Opposition in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) Subhash Arya, the number of trucks ferrying garbage from the dumps have come down as the Corporation has not extended their licences.''As a result where 10 truckloads are required to clear the garbage, only six truckloads are being lifted. The colony dumps look clear from outside, but inside they are full,'' said Arya. In Delhi nearly one-third of the garbage is lifted by private trucks. The Corporation has about 300 trucks of its own and the remaining are private. ''More than 1,000 tonnes of garbage is generated in Delhi everyday. MCD does not have enough number of trucks to lift the garbage, so it gives contract to private trucks,'' Arya said. Reacting to the statement of standing committee chairman Ram Babu Sharma that people are going to be fined for littering, Arya said the Corporation was exception to its own rule. Under the rules, not clearing garbage from the house can attract a fine of Rs 50 to a resident. The MCD plans to punish such people by deploying mobile magistrates who would fine people on the spot. ''They should put their own house in order first. What about their decision to not lift garbage from dumps in these localities in west Delhi? They (the Corporation) is exception to its own rule,'' he said. He also denied that the truckers are apprehensive following CBI raids last year. The agency found that many fake entries were made in the registers of the trucks which never appeared at the dumping site. As a result, the CBI prosecuted MCD employees and truckers and the payments were stopped. ''This is not the case here. Truck owners are willing to ply, but many of them have not been paid and licence of the several others have not been renewed,'' Arya said. Standing committee chairman was not available for comment.	1
NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh will grapple with the contentious issue of illegal immigration and terrorist activities during the visit of Bangladesh foreign minister Moreshed Khan from February 13-16.The visit, set up in a bid to defuse the sudden escalation on tensions over the issue of the illegal migrants, is the first since the bilateral relations took a turn for the worse.In November last, Bangladesh had protested against Indian allegations of terrorist activities being carried on from Bangladeshi soil. The charges, first levelled by Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, were subsequently repeated in Parliament by external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha. More recently, PM Vajpayee repeated the charges while addressing the chief ministers'' conference on security on Saturday.Bangladesh has already taken umbrage at the implication of the remarks but withheld a formal response on the ground that it was ascertaining the facts.Khan will arrive in India on February 13. His formal talks with Sinha will, however, take place only late on February 14 after his return from Ajmer Sharief. He has meetings with other senior leaders the following day with the possibility of a call on the PM before his return on February 16.	1
"NEW DELHI: Adopting a diplomatic stand on the BJP leadership controversy, the RSS on Friday said it was for the party to decide whether Atal Bihari Vajpayee or L K Advani should lead it in the next elections and asserted that both leaders were ""equal and close"" to Sangh.""It is for the party to decide. Both (Vajpayee and Advani) are Swayamsewaks (RSS volunteers).Both are equal and both are close to us,"" Sangh Spokesman Ram Madhav told reporters here when asked whether RSS agreed with the Prime Minister''s cryptic statement that Advani would lead the party to victory.Claiming there was no confusion within the BJP on the issue, Madhav said, ""they are our people. They will take a good decision. We may differ in identity and articulation but the vision and ideology remains the same.""Asked whether RSS would like to see Advani as Prime Minister since it had ""helped"" him in becoming Deputy Prime Minister, the spokesman said, ""we have been assisting both.""""The party will decide. The party has made it clear that Vajpayee would be its leader for next five years. We don''t have any objection,"" Ram Madhav said.To a question about the titles ''Vikas Purush'' and ""Lauh Purush'' given by the party to Vajpayee and Advani respectively he said, ""while Advani has been known as Lauh Purush for the past 10 years, Vajpayee is known as ''Vikas Purush'' since past five years as he could carry out development after becoming Prime Minister.""The RSS spokesman said the Prime Minister''s remarks on Advani reflected Vajpayee''s ""large heartedness, confidence and faith in Advani''s capabilities. It shows the mutual respect and confidence shared between the two leaders.""Interestingly, while talking about Advani''s description as ""Lauh Purush"" (Iron Man), Ram Madhav took pains to dwell at length on the Government''s ""success"" in busting several ISI modules in the country and foiling the designs of Pakistan-backed terrorists.He went on to add that the credit went equally to both Vajpayee and Advani.Significantly, Madhav had on Thursday said RSS ""fully endorsed"" BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu''s statement that Vajpayee would lead the party and that he was the ""number one"" leader of the country. ""It is a very appropriate decision at this point in time,"" the RSS spokesman had said. Advani is believed to be closer to RSS than Vajpayee due to his hardliner image and ""unapologetic"" stand on Hindutva. Madhav, however, quickly added that Vajpayee was known for his liberal image for the past 50 years."	0
NAGPUR: The ruling Congress suffered a major blow in by-elections to the nine seats of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) when it lost three seats while the BJP-Sena enhanced their strength in the 134-member house.Congress, which had contested four seats, could win only one while BJP-Sena, which had struck a pre-poll alliance, won three seats each. Two seats were bagged by independents in the bypolls held on April 13.The elections were necessitated for nine seats as the sitting corporators, all from scheduled tribe category, were disqualified over a period of time by caste scrutiny committee for allegedly submitting false certificates.BJP won three out of four seats it contested while Shiv Sena increased the tally from two to five after winning three seats on Tuesday. In all, 42 candidates were in fray for nine seats.Now in the house of 134, BJP has 50, Shiv Sena 5, Independents 11, Congress 47, NCP 9, BSP 9 and Lok Manch 3.The independents are mostly Congress rebels who were earlier supporting the party in the house.

"KOLKATA: The 10-storeyed Krishna Building on A.J.C. Bose Road-Ballygunge Circular Road crossing wears a spooky appearance. At 2 in the afternoon, yet the entire building was in pitch darkness.At a distance several voices could be heard, but the men and women behind the voices remained invisible. The building houses some of the swankiest offices in the city.But, from the evening of April 24 the building has been without power. And no one quite knows why.Dipankar Ray, manager of R.R. Financial Consultants said the heat had been unbearabl. ""Our work has suffered because the computers cannot be operated. There seems to be no solution in sight,"" Ray told TNN. Vijay Jain, director of Hi Funda. com also seemed at his wits end.""There is no proper schedule of maintenance in this building. This breakdown was inevitable. The building has a 60 per cent occupancy. Nearly a third of the firms which bought office space here don't bother to pay either electricity or maintenance charges,"" claimed Jain.At the CESC head office, a senior public relations official sounded surprised when told about the 'electricityless building'. ""We have got in touch with both our Loss Control Cell and the Commercial Cell and they have both assured us that they have not cut off electricity lines to this building for either non-payment or theft,"" he said.When TNN contacted Sandeep Bhutoria, one of the co-promoters of the complex, confirmed that the building was without power since April 24. ""We informed CESC, a team came and inspected the power lines, and discovered that the transformer had packed up. All offices are running on the standby generators. A new back up generator has also been arranged,"" He denied that the owners had not paid the CESC their dues."	0
NEW DELHI: After a working committee meeting of the TMC in Kolkata on Saturday, Mamata told BJP president N Venkiah Naidu that the Trinamul Congress would withdraw support if Sudip Bandhopadhyay joined the ministry without her approval. She added that he may be suspended from the party before the reshuffle. An expelled MP cannot be made a minister. After this, Naidu informed Mamata that the TMC was being kept out of the Cabinet for the time being and any further decision will be taken after discussions with her.Sudip has been informed that he is not being made a minister. On Thursday, it was decided that Vajpayee would inform Mamata about his decision to include her. But Fernandes was later given the job of telling her. But having heard of Sudip's inclusion by then, Mamata refused the offer on Friday. On Friday, BJP president N Venkiah Naidu told Mamata to be in Delhi for the induction. She agreed. Sudip was also informed by the government that he would be made a minister. But overnight things changed. Why? Mamata wanted surface transport or civil aviation and not coal. But her main problem with the reshuffle was that Sudip was being inducted without her approval. Her arguement: If NDA convenor George Fernandes was sent to Chennai to consult MDMK leader Vaiko on who should replace the party's minister of state for finance Ramachandran, why wasn't the TMC leader consulted about Sudip. Within the Vajpayee government, there appeared to be a major difference of opinion on the issue. Fernandes and joint secretary in the PMO Sudhindra Kulkarni played key roles in the drama that unfurled. Mamata has had good relations with both. Fernandes supported Mamata's point of view. But Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, it is believed, was keen on bringing Sudip into the ministry. Even Naidu assured him of a Cabinet berth.	0
"NEW DELHI: Is the media alone responsible for many problems being faced by the country currently? Its answer depends on one''s perception about the role media plays in areas of public interest. Its role has been lauded by various institutions dealing with the matters of public and national interests. Doubts have also been expressed over its role in certain other matters.The core question however is whether media should remain a silent spectator and stopped from making any valued comments to further public interest? Again, there would be conflicting views on the issue, but at least judiciary should not object to the information media offers in different forms on matters of historical importance such whether a temple or a mosque was in existence at the disputed site which is a bone of contention between different claimants. The Supreme Court had refused to answer the presidential query saying it was not within its domain to investigate such a matter which was purely a job of the archaeology experts. It did not object to the conflicting media reports even when the presidential reference was under consideration. At so many other occasions, the court had said the judges were no weak as to get influenced with what the press publishes. It also allowed a private channel to telecast a film on the Parliament attack despite a strong protest made by the accused. The court said the judicial temperament would not be affected and its telecast would not have no bearing on the judgment which was soon to come. Thus, the application of rule of sub judice is purely a matter of subjective satisfaction of the court concerned. No doubt the principle of sub judice must be applied strictly in the trial proceedings during which reputation of victims of crime and complainants are damned by the persons accused of heinous crimes. Many countries do not have a law preventing discussion on a matter pending before the court. It would be insulting to the learned judges who are capable of dissecting the issue and analysing it with meticulous judicial statesmanship to have carried away with what the media has said on the issue. Justice depends on the evidence and other material available to the court. In the sensational case of murder and rape of a Delhi law college student in which the son of an IPS officer was an accused and was also acquitted, the trial court had said that though he believed the accused had committed the crime, but there was not enough evidence to prove the charge. The media had played a vital role from the moment the girl was murdered in cold blood. Former Supreme Court judge V R Krishna Iyer has said: ""A developing democracy needs more speech,more communication even if a judicial process is pending"". It would be unfortunate if the judiciary applies the principle of sub judice strictly, for, it might be construed as the judges are not strong enough to sift the facts and appreciate the evidence and they are vulnerable to other information disseminated by the media. However, a special Bench of the Allahabad high court currently adjudicating on the suits relating to the disputed structure at Ayodhya has prohibited the telecast or publication of interviews and opinions of people on matters (the suit) pending before it, as it undermines the judicial authority and thwarts the majesty of the court, while it is yet to take a decision on the matter. But the print and electronic media is allowed to publish a fair and accurate report of court proceedings. But, it should not publish any articles, statement of witnesses and views of any person or its own opinion in editorial notes etc with regard to the merits of the case, the court has warned. The media is not restrained from reporting in regard to any order passed by the court or any of the proceedings of the court. There is a word of caution also: The report about an order of the court should be made after obtaining its true copy and the headline should not be misleading."	1
HYDERABAD: The city police successfully used a decoy for the first time, to arrest an inter-state criminal who specialised in diverting the attention of his victims and robbing them of their money.North zone DCP M V Ramachandra Raju claimed on Wednesday that as many as 45 cases of looting money by diverting people's attention have been reported since 2000.To check such offences, five decoy teams were formed with the help of maithri committee members.Dayanand, acting as a decoy, pretended as though he withdrew some cash, kept it in the car after counting it in public and went inside the Vijaya Bank on SD Road. The prime accused, Sundar Giri, 21, tried to divert the attention of the car driver on Tuesday by throwing some currency notes near the car and asking the latter to collect it. As the driver was already briefed, he caught the accused while trying to run away with the briefcase containing cash.	0
AMBALA: The cross examination of Anand Prakash, husband of Madhu Prakash, the complainant of Ruchika molestation case, was adjourned till June 13 by the court of special magistrate for CBI cases in Haryana Suryapratap Singh here on Saturday. The cross examination was postponed following an application filed by the counsel of S P S Rathore, former Haryana DGP on May 22.Rathore's counsel in the application pleaded the court to summon some of the concerned persons and relevant records necessary for cross examination of Anand. The CBI counsel opposed the application and said that Rathore was already aware of these documents. He said that Rathore had not stated in the application that why all these documents were required at this stage. The court would pronounce the order on the application on May 29. The arguments of counsels of CBI and Rathore concluded on Saturday. Madhu Prakash, Anand Prakash and SPS Rathore were also present in the court during the arguments.	0
BATHINDA: Turbines in unit number two of Guru Hargobind Thermal Plant at Lehra Mohabbat caught fire on Sunday evening. The entire unit had to be closed as a result. Four persons were injured while 25 others were rescued by employees at the thermal plant.Sources put the loss to the plant at over Rs 1 crore. The turbine caught fire around 5 pm following leakage of oil from a lubricant pipe.The seeping oil reportedly entered a turbine and caught fire.Once thick smoke from the turbine enveloped unit number two, employees raised an alarm. They were rescued after breaking glass windows and doors.MS Thind, chief engineer at the thermal plant, said the fire was brought under control by 7 pm by six fire tenders from Lehra Mohabbat, Rampura Phool, Bathinda and Barnala.He said power generation at unit number one of the plant was stopped and power supply to unit number two was completely snapped. The financial loss would be estimated after the fire was put out completely, he said.One of the injured has been shifted to Rampura civil hospital. The other three are being treated by doctors at the thermal plant.This is the second major fire at the plant. On April 29, 1998, a boiler at the plant had caught fire, resulting in a loss of over Rs 1 crore.	1
"NEW DELHI: A new report says domestic ivory trade is still widespread in the country. The ban has just driven it underground.A survey by TRAFFIC India, part of a wildlife trade monitoring network programme run by WWF and the World Conservation Union, found that Orissa, Assam and UP were among the most active production and collection centres, with the most active markets for worked ivory -- among the areas visited -- being Murshidabad, Udaipur, Jaipur, Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. Other areas of active ivory trading were outside main towns such as Varanasi, Bangalore and Mysore. Cities such as Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai are cited as retailing centres.Nepal, says the report, stands out as the international destination for Indian ivory carvings. In all, Indian ivory is believed to be exported upto 40 different countries.Examining the trade over two years, 2000 and 2001, the survey found foreigners as well as Indians purchase artefacts such as carvings, jewellery and seals produced in India. The report also identified a close link between demand for ivory artefacts among Indians and use in traditional ceremonies.According to the study, released Thursday, the main sources for raw ivory in India are poaching, domesticated elephants, smuggled African ivory and pre-existing ivory stock. The states which figure on the supply list include Assam, Orissa, Karnataka, UP and Uttaranchal.Despite the difficulties in gathering information on an illegal trade, the survey team found it ""surprisingly easy not only to locate, contact and speak to those involved in the ivory trade, but also to find those willing to supply ivory in carved as well as raw form. Overwhelming evidence, therefore, suggests that carving and trade in ivory, although reduced and largely opportunistic in nature, continues more or less clandestinely."" Profits, it seems, outweigh the risks of being caught.Calling for more rigorous enforcement of existing laws, the report says that between 1996 and 2001, an annual average of at least 270 kg of raw ivory was seized in the country, indicative of a large, continuing domestic market. This market, says the study, is particularly worrying given the documented, increasing global trend in international smuggling of ivory.India and Kenya have both opposed moves to reopen conditional ivory trade. The Elephant Trade Information System, a global monitoring system, indicates a direct link between international trade and large-scale, unregulated, domestic ivory markets. These markets in Africa and Asia have become more active since 1996 -- and need to be attacked if poaching is to be stopped."	1
LUCKNOW: Four more nominations were filed on Friday, bringing the total number of candidates who filed their papers for the biennial elections to the Vidhan Parishad to 13.With the Samajwadi Party expected to withdraw one candidate, elections to the 12 vacant seats of the Upper House is likely to be unopposed.Those who filed their papers on Friday were Ramji Singh, Raj Kumar Tyagi and Surendra Nath Awasthi alias Puttu Awasthi of the BJP and Ranjit Singh Judeo of the Congress.For Ramji Singh it will be a second term in the Vidhan Parishad if polls are held unopposed. Raj Kumar Tyagi is the president of western UP regional samitis of the BJP while Puttu Awasthi has apparently been rewarded for having vacated his Haidergarh seat in favour of former chief minister Rajnath Singh. Accompanying the BJP candidates at the time of filing nominations were senior leaders Rajnath Singh, Lalji Tandon, Vinay Katiyar and others.Ranjit Singh Judeo, a former minister, filed his papers as the Congress candidate.

"<div class=""section1""><div class=""Normal"">WASHINGTON: Pakistan's military ruler Pervez Musharraf is successfully playing the nuclear card to extract more conventional military supplies from the United States. <br /><br />In interviews to the western media ahead of his visit to Washington next week, Musharraf has warned the US and Europe not to allow India to develop a military superiority that would leave his country's nuclear arsenal as its only real deterrent.<br /><br />General Musharraf told the <span style="""" font-style:="""" italic="""">London Times</span> that a sharp rise in India's defence spending, coupled with restrictions on Pakistan buying military equipment abroad, threatened to create a adangerousa imbalance in force levels between the two rivals. <br /><br />In such circumstances Pakistan would have no choice but to rely on its nuclear weapons.<br /><br />The implied threat of further advancing its nuclear programme and doctrine of first use has Washington scrambling to mollify Pakistan with an arms package despite the country''s still tight financial situation and dependence on international aid, its explosive cocktail of fundamentalism and militarism, and the fact that it spends almost twice as much on the military as India in GDP terms. <br /><br />Although it seems unlikely that Washington will supply Pakistan with the latest generation F-16 fighter jets that Islamabad covets, it appears the Bush administration might be using the issue as a decoy to supply other weapons under the Indian radar. <br /><br />It now transpires that despite US and Indian denials that the issue F-16 supply to Pakistan figured in Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's talks with Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani in Washington last week, arms sales was discussed in a ageneral way.a<br /><br />Sources privy to the talks said aeighty per cent of the talks were about Iraq... but yes, the arms sales issue did crop up.a Advani is said to have expressed reservations about any resumption of arms sales given Pakistan's past history and chronic instability, but it now appears the US team may have thrown up the issue and used the fog of Iraq deployment to judge the extent of India's feelings on the matter. <br /><br />Administration and Congressional sources say there are no F-16s in the pipeline for Pakistan, but the US may be readying other military supplies including additional C-130 military planes, helicopter gunships, and even E-2C Hawkeye Radar Aircraft. <br /><br />Such supplies would require Congressional approval although the administration has the clout to push through any proposal in US national interest. One aspect of such interest would be to contain Pakistan''s nuclear programme.<br /><br />One Indian analyst noted a recent statement by one of Pakistan's top generals Mohammed Yunus that Islamabad would have to strengthen its conventional defences if its deterrent was not strong enough, an indication that Washington may be forcing Pakistan to cap its nuclear programme. <br /><br />The analyst, who still serves in the government and did not want to be named, also noted Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz's visit to Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) that raised a storm in Pakistan. Aziz, a former Citibank executive, is known in radical circles as aAmerica's boya who still retains his US citizenship. <br /><br />It is possible, the analyst said, that the US may be willing to open the conventional arms pipeline if in return it gets to handle Pakistan's nuclear programme.<br /><br />Indian officials believe the F-16s are not on the table because there has been no Congressional activity on this front. Even if the administration were to push forward with the proposal, Indians trust that Congressional interests would oppose it. <br /><br />The Indians are arguing that if the US fears that Pakistan's nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of radicals, the same could hold true of F-16s and other weapons too. <br /><br />But Washington, which has placed all its bets on Musharraf, is not buying that. The prevailing sentiment in the administration is that Pakistan needs to be reeled back from the edge, even if it means placating it with a package of conventional arms. <br /><br />The Bush administration also seems to feel that Musharraf needs something to show his civilian and military constituencies that going with Washington --or at least pretending to -- has its payoff.</div> </div>"	1

NEW DELHI: Myanmar has reiterated that it would not allow its territory to be used for anti-India activities. This was asserted during a low-key visit by Myanmar foreign minister U Win Aung. India and Myanmar signed a protocol on foreign office consultations and agreed to explore prospects of enhanced cooperation in hydro-electric projects, road construction and multi-modal transport.The protocol was signed by external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha and his Myanmar counterpart here after wide- ranging one-to-one and delegation-level talks.On the economic front, Myanmar is keen on Indian help to set up its IT sector. The visiting minister is due to go to Hyderabad to scout for IT firms that would be suitable for this collaboration.India is already engaged in offshore oil and gas exploration and has offered its expertise for on-shore operations as well, besides showing interest in Myanmar's power projects.The two sides also exchanged views on major regional and international issues, including the Iraq crisis.	1

PATNA: Leader of opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday criticised the state government for its failure in taking action against ministers and MLAs allegedly providing shelter to criminals in their residences. Kidnapped persons are now kept in the residences of ministers and MLAs. If the government is really interested in checking the 'kidnapping industry' in Bihar, it must end the nexus between criminals and politicians, Modi said at a press conference organised on the premises of the BJP office here.The kidnappers of Dr Bharat Singh were arrested from the residence of RJD MLA Jakir Mian in Patna. But the police deliberately changed the place of their arrest in the police record, Modi said and added that one Indrajit Singh, allegedly involved in a number of kidnapping cases, was recently arrested from the house of RJD MLC Vishnu Deo Roy. Moreover, the government failed to take any action against LJP MLA Rama Singh whose name recently figured in the kidnapping case of Dr Umesh Singh of Hazaribag. At least on three occasions, police arrested criminals from the residence of Ezazul Haque, the minister of state for social welfare. Even notorious criminal Sultan had confessed to his relations with the minister as that of a master and a servant following his arrest. Yet the government did not bother to seek any explanation from Haque over the issue, Modi said. Modi claimed that the names of several ministers and MLAs had figured in the confessional statements made by criminals arrested by the police in the recent past. The confessional statement made by notorious criminal Sadik Sandani is a case in point. He was arrested by the police in Kishanganj. He has disclosed about his relations with building construction minister Taslimuddin and his private secretary Polo Jha in his statement made before the police, Modi said. He also accused Sarfaraj, son of the minister, of patronising criminals. To a query, Modi said: The BJP wants action against all politicians who are patronising criminals. Who has stopped the government from taking action against controversial MLAs or MPs belonging to the BJP or the Samata.	1

The HMC move is being opposed by the Dalit Safai Karmi Basti Bachao Samity and the Akhil Bharatiya Sudharshan Panchayat Samity.On January 24, more than 1,000 people demonstrated in front of the mayor's office in protest. The Green Bench of the Calcutta High Court had ordered the park to be cleared following a submission by the HMC that ""there is encroachment inside the park"".The eviction had earlier been scheduled for January 19, but Shekhar Dutta, SDO (Sadar), advised the HMC not to begin the operation before January 26.

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has busted a money-changing racket and arrested two city money changers for swindling Rs 2.55 crore by illegally replacing new notes from bank cash chests with mutilated notes. The money changer has been identified as Ajay Kumar Singhla and his son Sunil Kumar. The CBI had earlier arrested two officials working in the Bank of Baroda's Parliament Street branch in New Delhi for conniving with some persons and causing financial loss to the bank.The money-changers deliberately cut or mutilated parts from eight currency notes to create a ninth mutilated note that would have at least four digits of the serial number on only one side. The money-changers would then replace these nine notes with new ones from the cash chest of the bank in connivance with the bank employees. This went undetected as the Reserve Bank India rules say that a mutilated note can be exchanged if it has only four digits of the serial number.	0

"NEW DELHI: In an effort to placate an angry RSS, BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu met the outfit's chief K Sudarshan on Sunday to brief him about the chintan baithak in Mumbai and explain the government's initiative on Ayodhya.The four-day brainstorming session, which ended on June 20, was attended by top BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Vajpayee and Deputy PM Advani.Among the issues that were discussed were the timing of the next Lok Sabha elections and the party's ties with the BSP in UP.Sunday's meeting, which lasted for almost two hours, is significant as Naidu made this special effort to meet Sudarshan for a personal briefing even though Madan Das Devi a"" who is in-charge of BJP in the RSS a"" was among those who participated in the deliberations at Mumbai.The RSS and the other Sangh outfits, like the VHP, have been critical of the BJP leadership for its handling of the Ayodhya issue.Apparently upset over the Centre's move to involve the Kanchi Shankaracharya in resolving the Ayodhya tangle, the RSS chief reportedly asked Naidu to ensure the passage of a legislation providing for the construction of a Ram Temple.Naidu conveyed the government's inability to get such a law passed as the NDA does not have the requisite numbers in Parliament. Sudarshan also said Kashi and Mathura were non-negotiable."	0
PATNA: Documents seized by the investigation wing of income-tax (I-T) department during the search operation carried out at Steel Corner, a shop of trader Uday Gupta located along Ashok Rajpath, have revealed that the trader had not accounted for a transaction of over Rs 80 lakh.The director general, investigation (DGI), I-T, Bihar and Jharkhand, Ashutosh Singh Thakur, on Monday told TNN that the department had sought an explanation from Uday Gupta in this regard.The transaction took place during the current financial year itself, he said.Uday Gupta is one of the three Gupta brothers whose business and residential premises were searched by the I-T department on February 27. The names of the two other brothers are Arjun Gupta and Vijay Gupta. Thakur said that the department would get the Anand Vihar Apartment, allegedly owned by Gupta brothers, re-evaluated. The cost of the building was estimated to be around Rs 1 crore, he said. The building houses Partech Education Private Limited and Guinea Motors, the two business concerns of Gupta brothers. The I-T department had also searched Guinea House and Patna Guinea House, both located on Ashok Rajpath, on Thursday.Thakur said that a document seized from the residence of Arjun Gupta revealed an unaccounted transaction of Rs 8 lakh for the purchase of a plot for his daughter. Although the plot was purchased at a cost of Rs 11 lakh, it was shown to have been purchased at a cost of Rs 3 lakh only, he said.He said that the department had also asked Vijay Gupta to explain the availability of five kilograms of gold at the Patna Guinea House. He said that Vijay had earlier said that the gold belonged to his family and he had invested it in his jewellery shop.

"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday strongly opposed the government''s decision on disinvestment in HPCL and BPCL saying that the oil and gas industry is an important part of the strategic sector.""The Congress has consistently and strongly opposed withdrawal of the State from the strategic sector of which hydrocarbon is a vital part. This position was clearly articulated in the party''s Plenary Session at Bangalore,"" party Spokesman S Jaipal Reddy told reporters here.There was no compulsion at all to sell off the two oil companies, he said strongly disapproving of the ""unilateral"" steps taken by the government on the issue.""The party''s opposition remains undiluted and unchanged,"" he said, adding the problem with the NDA government is that privatisation has become a ""religion"" for it.Besides, in an apparent reference to war clouds over Iraq, he said such a step should not be taken in the strategic sector ""when there was so much uncertainty in the world."""	1
LUCKNOW: In a blatant misuse of position, a deputy inspector-general (DIG) rank officer is alleged to have grabbed a portion of a graveyard adjacent to his Vishwas Khand house in Gomtinagar. Having installed a generator set and tent for the police guard, the officer was now understood to be preparing to build a temporary structure there. On a complaint to the chief minister by the caretaker committee of the graveyard, an IG was asked to inquire into the allegation.But it is learnt that since the concerned lekhpal in his official report had certified that the disputed site was a part of the graveyard, his statement had not been included in the inquiry report. Not to be left behind, a top IAS officer serving in the state housing department, is alleged to have got the master plan altered to grab a plot of land belonging to a Hanuman temple, also in Gomtinagar. The legal care-taker of the property got a stay order from the high court to maintain status quo at the site. But overlooking the stay order, this influential officer at a special meeting of the LDA's executive committee got the master plan changed to include the temple land. In further violation of the court's order, green trees on the plot were felled recently. The land is now planned to be given to four different parties. These four would be much better equipped to fight the court case as compared to the temple priest who has limited means. As if UP cadre babus were not enough, a Bihari counterpart too followed suit. He has grabbed a massive chunk lying vacant opposite Sahara complex at Kapoorthala. This IPS officer and his father had staked their claim for the plot of land with a special secretary in the state home department playing a supporting role. But his claim has run into rough weather with another top boss of the home department claiming that the land was his. And in the tug-of-war that continues, a sub-inspector (SI) from Aliganj police station who dared to rush to the scene on an SOS was put under suspension on charges of bribe. The list is seemingly endless. The new breed of land grabbers is flourishing.	1
MUMBAI: A 12-year-old boy toils for hours in a brick kiln, sweating it out in the heat. Like him, over one million children work in the state, many in hazardous conditions, in sugarcane factories and powerlooms--industries banned under the Child Labour Prohibition and Regulation Act, 1986. State officials aren't exactly cracking down on these units. Instead, they are organising two-hour study programmes or seminars for these working children, occasionally even teaching them about child rights.The irony appears lost on the state government, but child rights' organisations have started raising questions about the legitimacy of the state's non-formal education programmes. While not denying the importance of educating children, they contend that the state is overlooking the children's rescue and rehabilitation. Activists say that in many cases, parents look upon the government programmes as a way out of sending their children to school. Hemant Bhamre, of Lok Vikas Samajik Sanstha in Nashik, points out that around 300 children dropped out of the municipal school in Nashik to enrol in the non-formal education classes. Some parents think that their child can work while studying in these classes. This in fact encourages child labour,'' he says. Both the central and state governments have a handful of non-formal education schemes for children out of school. The state government's Mahatma Phule Yojana, the central government's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the labour ministry's Central Board for Workers Education offer non-formal education options for working children. The official line is that these bridge'' programmes help children join mainstream schools later. Dr Vasant Kalapande, director of primary education with the state government's education department and project director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, says,Of 15 lakh children identified as out of school, we could enrol 10 lakh in formal schools.'' But, there are complaints that the classes are conducted by under-qualified and underpaid teachers. The labour department -- which is supposed to carry out rescue operations for children working in hazardous conditions--conducts two-day seminars for the children and their parents. Interestingly, the seminars are about 'child rights'. The department justifies holding seminars for working children by hiding behind technicalities. The Child Labour Act uses the term 'regulation' which means helping working children. We are doing that. We create awareness among children and parents about health, hygiene and their rights,'' says a labour department official.	1
"NEW DELHI: As part of the rapidly increasing bilateral military ties, Indian and American special forces will hold a joint exercise at the US Pacific Command base in Guam in June.This comes shortly after a three-week joint exercise, code named Balance Iroquois-Vajra Prahar, which was conducted under a veil of secrecy at the Army's counter-insurgency and jungle-warfare school in Varangate (Mizoram) last month.The ""intense"" exercise involved tactics in counter-insurgency and marksmanship, heliborne and airborne operations, modus operandi of militants and jungle survival, intelligence operations and raids. The exercise included simulation of a tough hostage situation, which was overcome by a joint action group of the two forces.Officials say the two sides want to build ""inter-operability"" between armed forces after the thaw in the post-Pokhran-II freeze. The future may well witness joint combat operations against a common enemy or terrorist threat.India and the US have decided to progressively increase the scope and content of the joint exercises. US Navy SEALS and the Indian Navy Marine Commando Force, for instance, are scheduled to match their ""unconventional"" and ""clandestine"" warfare skills in a joint exercise to be held later this year. In an another first, India and the US will hold a joint air combat exercise with frontline fighter jets around that time."	0
SHIMLA: Only two days after taking oath of office, the Congress government acting on its statement to remove corruption had a team of the state enforcement department raid the office of the State Subordinate Service Selection Board (SSSSB) at Hamirpur and seal its records.Sources said that the raid was conducted by Shimla DIG J K Gupta following complaints of alleged corruption in its functioning.The main complaint being that jobs were allegedly given on political or other considerations.They said that the raiding party had got search warrants from a local judge and sealed the premises on Friday night. The raiding party also included Hamirpur police chief Aghishek Trivedi, while the secretary of the board, Rakhi Kahlon, who was summoned is said to have helped in providing the required records.Board chairman SM Katwal and another member Tashi Dawa were out of town. However, later in the evening the enforcement team sealed the chairman's residence. Seals had been put on the locks of the residence and the main gate.When contacted, former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal said that the Congress government was free to inquire and probe whatever it wanted to. aIf any one is responsible for any acts of omission or commission, then he will suffera, he added.	0
NEW DELHI: US ambassador Robert Blackwill had a 30-minute meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister on Thursday morning, shortly before the latter''s departure for Thailand and Singapore. They are believed to have discussed the Iraq issue besides bilateral matters.On his foreign trip, Advani will be accompanied by Home Secretary N Gopalaswamy and other senior officials.He will take up matters relating to strengthening the global fight against terrorism with the leaders of the two nations.Advani''s first stop will be Bangkok where he will meet Thai PM Thaksin Shinawatra and DPM and Law Minister Wissan Kreya-Ngam during his three-day stay in that country.Security-related issues, including the campaign against terror and steps to enhance the over $1 billion trade between India and Thailand as also creating a free trade zone will top the agenda of Advani''s talks, official sources said on Thursday.New Delhi has also been discussing with Bangkok a treaty for mutual legal assistance and transfer of convicted offenders besides ways to combat drug trafficking and smuggling of arms.The sources, however, said that no agreement would be signed during the DPM''s visits to Thailand and Singapore. Advani, who will reach Singapore on Sunday after visiting the Thai tourist resort of Phuket, will meet President S R Nathan, PM Goh Chok Tong and Home Minister Wong Kan Seng.While Singapore is a major investor in India from the South-East Asian region, Thailand has 26 joint venture projects with Indian companies.Singapore had a couple of months ago busted a major al-Qaeda network which had plans to create terror there and hit the city state economically.Thailand has been a base for north-eastern insurgent groups and criminals, who have so far been using that country as a base after having fled India.The DPM will also meet members of the Indian community in both countries before returning on February 5.	1

NEW DELHI: Old India hand and career diplomat Aziz Ahmed Khan would be Pakistan's new High Commissioner to New Delhi, following quick acceptance of his name by the government, paving the way for restoration of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. India gave its consent to the 'Agreement' sent on Monday by Islamabad with Khan's name for the crucial diplomatic post.Khan is expected to take up his new assignment soon. Khan will come in place of Ashraf Jehangir Qazi who was asked to be withdrawn by India in the wake of the terror attack on the families of Army personnel in Kaluchak near Jammu in May last year. New Delhi has already appointed India's Ambassador to China, Shivshanker Menon, as the new High Commissioner to Islamabad. This will be 59-year old Khan's second stint in New Delhi. He had earlier served as a Minister and Deputy High Commissioner to India during 1985-87. Back in Islamabad, Khan served as Director General (South Asia) and was closely associated with India-related issues. He is currently spokesman of the Pakistan foreign office and due to retire later this year.	1
"NEW DELHI: Harcharan Singh Pattu, sarpanch of Khemkaran village in Punjab is a disillusioned man. His six-acre farm along the Indo-Pak border was mined by the Army at the launch of Operation Parakram. He''s still waiting for it to be de-mined. ""It has been 14 months since the army took over my land. I was given compensation for last year''s wheat crop at the rate of Rs 11,000 per acre.How far will this money taken me? I have 12 family members and eight heads of cattle to feed. I have lost three crops since last January and am awaiting further compensation,"" he says. There are thousands of farmers like him along the border. Take Nirmal Singh of Rajocanna village in Punjab. ""Farming is my only source of livelihood. How can I survive if the army does not give us quick compensation on a per crop basis?"" Army sources confirm it took over 70,000 hectares of land; more than one-third of cultivable land was mined with an estimated one million mines. And they admit, so far only 30 per cent of land has been de-mined. Simranjit Singh Mann, MP, says, ""The compensation being demanded by the farmers runs into several crores. So far, they''ve not received even a quarter of this amount."" The Centre has sanctioned compensation of Rs 66 crore and Rs 54 crore for Punjab and Rajasthan respectively. An MoD spokesman said, ""Compensation will be given on the basis of assessments made by district officials."" The farmers contend that only 10 per cent have received compensation. The army''s figures are way above this: 70 per cent in Punjab, 50 per cent in Rajasthan and 40 per cent in J&K. Another worry for the farmers is the time-frame of the de-mining exercise. They want their fields back soon. Unfortunately, the army is reported to have de-mined the 20,000 hectare stretch from Kashmir to Rajasthan using vintage ND-Mark 11 and Mark-V mines."	0

LUCKNOW: Though the CB-CID has been given 30 days from last Saturday to submit an interim report on the Madhumita murder case and the involvement of ex-minister Amarmani Tripathi, the agency appears more determined to ensure that the information is not leaked to the press, than tracing the culprits. Sources said that the CB-CID bosses on Sunday, despite being a weekly off, called a closed-door meeting to issue directives on maintaining secrecy on the investigations as, otherwise, immediate punitive action would be taken against those found mixing with the press.Giving reference to the time when the investigations were with the district police, the top CB-CID bosses are learnt to have exemplified the issue with the ouster of SSP Lucknow Anil Kumar Agarwal. The CM had taken the issue of leak to the press seriously and further action against some officials is on the cards. The probe team was told that the CB-CID bosses would not wait for the CM to initiate action but the department would itself ensure that such officers were dealt with sternly. On the other hand, after all the documents were handed over to the CB-CID officials by the district police, the sleuths from the crime branch took custody of the lone eye-witness of the gory killing, domestic help of Madhumita, 10-year-old Deshraj, who was present in the house at the time of the killing. He was taken away by the CB-CID officials to record his statements. Director-General CB-CID Mahendra Lalka on Monday told Times News Network that the department had begun with the investigations. Replying to a question, he assured a fair trial by the sleuths and said that all care would be taken to ensure that the guilty were be brought to books. Sarojni Nagar police in no way was associated with the investigations into the Madhumita murder case. But still the Station Officer (SO) of the police station raided the hostel rooms at Kanpur IIT on the night of May 16, to trace Anuj Misra, the so-called engineering student who had supposedly married Madhumita in November last. More so, Anuj Misra, who was last spotted at his hostel room before the raid, has been missing since. It was not confirmed if Anuj disappeared before the raid or was taken away by the police itself. These issues have again cropped up mysteries related to role of the police. Though SO Sarojni Nagar was not available for comments, another question which remains unanswered is why the police officer is residing at the government accommodation of a power(ful) minister in Hussainganj. That the name of this minister has been associated with the Madhumita murder because of his alleged links with her sister Nidhi, is another matter.	0
"SRINAGAR: The Central government has decided to redeploy the Border Security Force at the borders and utilize the services of Central Reserve Police Force for internal security duties in Jammu and Kashmir, BSF Inspector General G S Gill said here on Sunday.""The government of India has taken a policy decision whereby CRPF has been selected as the main force to fight insurgency and BSF to guard the borders to further strengthen the frontiers of the country"", Gill told reporters after unfurling the national tricolour at the historic Lal Chowk here.He said the process will be set in motion this year but it had not yet been decided in which sector BSF will be reinducted first.Official sources said initially eight battalions of CRPF will take over from BSF to fight insurgency in the state. Later, it will gradually relieve BSF from internal security duties and don the mantle to fight insurgency in the state. The process will take few months time, he added.Expressing satisfaction over the peaceful passing off of Republic Day celebrations, Gill said apart from the usual militant threats, this year there were specific warnings about vehicles being prepared for fidayeen (suicide) attacks.""In fact we even reacted to two or three specific reports and in one case actually recovered an IED (improvised explosive device) which was supposed to be in a car but was found on the roadside"", the IG BSF said adding ""we have taken all the threats seriously and have managed to keep the day peaceful""."	1
"LUCKNOW: Taking a serious note of the report published in this newspaper on Monday, the deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Lucknow Range, A K Dwivedi, ordered a probe into the conduct of the police in the case involving the murder of a minor in Hardoi.In the police investigation started afresh, an MLA''s son has figured as the prime accused along with his associates whom the police claim to have identified.They could not be arrested till late evening on Monday as they were absconding, the DIG said.A 15-year-old boy Nirmal was allegedly subjected to barbaric acts and assaulted reportedly by his employer Anurag Misra, who is the son of Dharmagya Misra, a former Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA, and his four associates for four days before he died on June 23. The brutal act was allegedly resorted to after Anurag''s illegal countrymade pistol was found missing from the house. Anurag suspected Nirmal''s hand in the theft.The DIG told this newspaper that the police had now named the former MLA''s son Anurag as an accused in the murder case. ""Involvement of a few of his associates has also come to light and the police have managed to identify them as well,"" he said adding that their identities were not being disclosed. Regarding the arrest of Anurag, Dwivedi said that after initial efforts fail to trace him, police would seek court''s orders for attaching his property.Regarding the role of the Hardoi police, which initially dismissed the incident as that of cholera death, Dwivedi said that a preliminary inquiry was conducted by a local officer which stated that Nirmal''s mother had submitted a written complaint with the local police on June 23 itself stating that her son died of cholera. When pointed out by this correspondent that Nirmal''s mother had denied having given any complaint, the DIG promised to dispatch a special team from his office to ascertain the truth."	0

"MUMBAI: Godrej Baug, a building on the quiet, plush reaches of the Napean Sea Road area, is an unlikely place for a mini civil revolt. But on January 10, the 450-odd families living there joined the battle. They pulled out the cable plugs of their building.The Godrej Baug residents were not alone. Tired of being harassed and overcharged, people from the nearby Meherina building and Malabar Apartments joined them in throwing out the cable operatora""Alden Rebello of Sky Link.Days away from the World Cup, the residents have decided they would go without cricket, but would not put up with cable trouble.Consumer resistance against alleged harassment by cable operators is gaining unprecedented momentum in several parts of the city. In Bhandup, for instance, thousands attended an open public rally recently to protest against their cable operators allegedly overcharging them. The residents threatened to cut off their cable connections.In case of the Godrej Baug operator, he charged Rs 350 per connection per month. He insisted that the residents pay by cash, and most often only a soft bill is produced, residents say. A complaint alleging harassment has been filed by Godrej Baug resident at the local police station against the operator.In adjacent Simla House, where Mr Rebello is the secretary of the housing society, the protests have been stifled by the threat that connections will be cut, residents say. ""We moved the consumer court over harassment and collected hundreds of signatures from building residents,"" said a Simla House resident.Consumer groups like the Mumbai Grahak Panchayat and the Consumer Guidance Society of India are flooded with letters about arbitrary rate increases, cable blackouts, the monopolistic arrogance of the operators and their steadfast refusal to produce receipts.Rajiv Vyas, COO, IncableNet, a multi-service operator from whom ground operators (including Mr Rebello) get the signals, said that the operator is often helpless because of broadcasters revising prices arbitrarily and ask for a declaration of double the number of existent connections. ""However, when there is a case against the operator, we treat it according to the merit of the case,"" he said. He claimed that he is not aware of the specifics of the Godrej Baug-Simla House situation."	1
"NEW DELHI: It''s almost 5.30 pm. There are more appointments to go and many more files to sign. There''s a sense of urgency as she paces the room. A far cry form the archetypal politician, she could easily be anarticulate, suave bureaucrat.""I find women more committed to their work,"" said Sheila Dikshit, the Capital''s second and longest serving woman chief minister.""Very competent, they bring to their job a humane touch,"" she said.It was this that fired her decision to pick Debashree Mukherjee as the city''s first woman excise commissioner. ""When I was told we needed a new excise commissioner, I said: ''Here is an officer, talented and with a clean image,""'' Dikshit said.For the first time our city is literally being run by womena"" from the CM to the chief secretary, the mayor to the excise commissioner, transport commissioner and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) chairperson. And many are the first women to hold these posts.""At this level, gender ceases to matter. But acceptance in a decision-making post is still not total,"" Dikshit said. ""We tend to be slotted in predictable brackets. How many times have we heard of a woman finance minister? Or a woman defence minister? If we have a war council some day, will we have a woman on it?""A passout from Convent of Jesus and Mary and Miranda House, followed by a Masters'' in History, Dikshit''s first brush with power came with her marriage to IAS officer Vinod Dikshit. ""He introduced me to public life. I was keen on social work and he encouraged me,"" she said.But marriage didn''t assure her smooth sailing in public life. ""Although I was chief executive of a government exporting association, I found members sceptical about my abilities,"" she said.""When women head departments, you don''t have people turning around saying that a man could have done a better job. That''s the biggest advantage of having women on top,"" says NMC chairman PM Singh. A post-graduate in geography from Punjab University, Singh wanted to do a PhD. ""But my family suggested the civil services examination. And I don''t regret the decision today,"" Singh said.Neither does Shailaja Chandra, the city''s first woman chief secretary. ""I was keen on theatre and even worked as a copy writer,"" said Chandra, who heads the city''s bureaucracy. A masters in economics from the University of Swansea, Wales, Chandra joined the Civil Services in 1966. Luckier than many women struggling to beat sterotypes in male bastions, this second generation IAS officer faced little resistance. ""I look at this posting as my profession and want to be known as an officer rather than a woman. I can''t remember being singled as a woman,"" she saidNeither can transport commissioner Sindhushree Khullar. ""I never sensed any discrimination,"" remembers Khullar, who is also secretary mass rapid transit system and tourism.""As women we were curiously hesitant to take our problems to the office, while men would do it comfortably,"" she said.She feels her junior colleagues are more comfortable about doing so. However, what irks her she is the tendency of women to use family to excuse sloppiness. ""But that is the general malaise of Delhi a"" basic discipline is missing. Women in my office walk in at 11 am and want to leave by 4 pm, in Mumbai that is unheard of,"" she says.She says hanging on to her job has been her biggest achievement. Whether it was the CNG conversion issue or the recent auto fare revision, she been in the public eye. But, Khullar handles her powers with the grace her 28 years of service has bestowed."	0
THRISSUR: Thousands of people witnessed the famous ''Thrissur Pooram'' on Saturday, the festival of festivals comprising day and night carnival of colourful pageantries, parade of caparisoned tuskers and a profuse exhibition of Kerala''s traditional art forms.The Pooram started with the convergence of processions from eight temples in and around at the famous Vadakkumnathan Temple located on a hillock in the heart of the city.The famous Kudamattom (change of ornamental umbrellas) by mahouts on top of 15 caparisoned elephants lined up on each side of the sprawling Thekinkadu Maidan was held amidst the beat of percussion instruments.The Pooram, drawing a large crowd from far and wide cutting across religious and regional barriers, was started in 1798 through a royal proclamation by prince Raja Rama Varma, popularly known as Sakthan Thampuran, of erstwhile Kochi state. The main poorams conducted in a competitive spirit by Paramekkavu and Thiruvambady Devaswoms end with a spectacular display of the fire works in the wee hours of Sunday. This year''s pooram is the 205th edition of the annual event.	0
MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar has diluted his opposition to persons with foreign origin occupying top constitutional positions in the country. Pawar said that in the present context, the issue of consolidation of secular forces to oppose BJP-led fundamentalist forces was more important. He was talking to reporters after a two-day marathon NCP meeting.Asked whether he would still persist with the issue of foreign origin if mid-term Lok Sabha elections are held in the near future, Pawar, however, gave a clear hint that the issue was more important for his party. The NCP chief has given instructions to his state unit to remain prepared for midterm elections to the Lok Sabha as well as the state assembly. He pointed out that since senior BJP and Congress leaders are talking about mid-term polls, his party could not ignore such a possibility. NCP's state unit president, R.R. Patil, has made it clear that his party was opposed to mid-term polls to the state assembly. However, if there is any such eventuality, we will definitely fight all the 288 assembly elections, he said. Pawar had given an open offer to the Congress for a pre-poll alliance to fight the Shiv Sena-BJP combine in the state six months ago during Vilasrao Deshmukh's tenure as chief minister. However, so far there has been no positive response from the Congress. Asked about the possibility of the NCP joining hands with the Congress in the next elections, Pawar said, The process of joining hands with other like-minded parties will start seriously only after elections are announced. Asked whether social activist Anna Hazare's allegations of corruption against four NCP ministers were discussed at the meeting, Pawar said the party would discuss the issue only after the allegations were proved. Hazare has targeted food and civil supplies minister Suresh Jain, irrigation minister Dr Padamsinh Patil, minister of state for general administration Dr Vijay Gavit and minister of state for housing Nawab Malik.	0
"HYDERABAD: The People's War is encouraging some selected surrendered militants to return to the movement. At the same time, the police want to use this as an opportunity to infiltrate the Marxist-Leninist movement and eliminate some top leaders.Two former prominent naxalites a"" G Janardhan of Nizamabad and B Ganganna of Karimnagar a"" have gone underground, sources said.It is learnt that police officers in some Telangana districts have held meetings with former naxalites and divided them into two groups a"" those who surrendered till the end of 2001 and those who gave up later.The sources said a lot of importance is being attached to the latter group as they give recent information on the PW. They are being asked to choose their targets if they return to the forest. Arms and ammunition and the logistics will be taken care of by police, the sources added.This is reportedly a revival of the tactics already used by the police. These tactics had to be suspended after a nexus between the police and surrendered naxalites came to light with the death of Kattula Sammaiah in a freak mishap at the Colombo airport in Sri Lanka two years ago.With police support, Sammaiah and many former naxalites had formed gangs to settle money and land disputes. There are allegations that the police are finding it difficult to control their criminal activities even today.Following these charges, police had temporarily suspended taking the help of former naxalites in operations against their earlier comrades. On the other hand, the PW had killed former naxalites branding them as police informers. But the recent spurt of naxalite violence has prompted the police to resume their contacts with former naxalites while the PW is learnt to have been forced to call them back due to a fall in recruitment, sources told The Times of India."	1

"NEW DELHI: India has proposed the setting up of a global panel of countries most affected by terrorism for sharing and devising methods to tackle the menace. The proposal was made on Saturday by CBI director P C Sharma at a meeting of Interpol officials from various countries based in Delhi. Sharma said such a committee would help fight terrorist and criminal activities, particularly cyber crime.""Such countries as the US, Japan and Russia have developed technological barriers against these kinds of activities. A global committee will help share this knowledge and fight the menace more effectively,"" he said.Sharma called for concerted efforts by countries to simplify extradition laws which at present are cumbersome.The CBI is trying to extradite Bofors case accused Ottavio Quattrocchi from Malaysia and Bombay blasts accused Abu Salem from Portugal. It recently failed to extradite another blasts accused Anees Ibrahim from the UAE. He said ''Red Corner'' notices by the Interpol should be given greater legal sanctity by the countries."	1

GUWAHATI: While malaria, having claimed 62 lives in the state, has assumed an epidemic proportion, the Tarun Gogoi government is fighting a legal battle on whether to distribute five lakh medicated mosquito nets among the affected people.The Guwahati High Court is yet to dispose off the petition filed by the Assam government against the Centre''s ban on distribution of the medicated nets.The Centre has put the ban on distribution in view of the ongoing Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into anomalies in procurement of the nets.The Assam government filed a petition last year that New Delhi''s ban on distribution of mosquito nets was unreasonable considering the spread of the disease.Assam health and family welfare minister Bhumidhar Barman told TNN on Friday that rodents might have destroyed the nets at several godowns sealed by the CBI. The Centre had sent the nets to Assam when the AGP government was in power.The anti-malaria programme in Assam, where the disease rears its head every monsoon, is cent per cent sponsored by the Centre. Adding more disappointment to the Assam government, the medicines, which were supplied along with the medicated nets, were well past the expiry dates. The additional director of health services and state malaria programme officer, P C Bhattacharya, said that barring Dibrugarh, all the other 22 districts in Assam were malaria-prone. Nagaon has been adversely affected with five confirmed deaths and nine suspected deaths. There have been five confirmed deaths in Sonitpur and eight more are suspected to have been killed. There were four confirmed deaths in Dhemaji, three in North Lakhimpur, two in Golaghat and one each in Cachar and Karbi Anglong districts. The month of June is being observed as Malaria Month. As part of this campaign, 2,240 camps have been organised in different parts of the state for treatment of the affected people. As many as 950 DDT spraying squads have been formed. The health department''s woes have been compounded by the shortage of 400 health workers for malaria surveillance operations in villages.	1
"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India has revised the corporate debt restructuring guidelines, granting lenders an option to exit from the package by selling their stake to either existing or fresh lenders at an appropriate price, to be decided mutually.The proposals for the restructuring package should provide for option to a particular lender or lenders (outside the minimum 75 per cent who have agreed for restructuring) who for any internal reason, does/do not fully abide by CDR Empowered Group''s decision on restructuring, RBI said in a notification here on Wednesday. The new lenders shall rank on par with existing ones for repayment and servicing of the dues since they have taken over the existing dues, it said.In addition, the ''exit option'' would also be available to all other lenders within the minimum 75 per cent, provided the purchaser agrees to abide by the restructuring package cleared by the empowered group.The exiting lenders may be allowed to continue with their existing level of exposure to the borrower, provided they tie up with either the existing or fresh lenders for taking up their share of additional finance, it said.The CDR Empowered Group, while deciding the restructuring package, should also decide the issue regarding convertibility (into equity) option, it said.One of the other main features of the revised guidelines is the provision of two categories of debt restructuring under the CDR system. RBI said reference to the CDR system could be triggered by any or more of the creditor who have minimum 20 per cent share in either working capital or term finance, or by concerned corporate, if supported by a bank or financial institution having stake as in the first case.Though the flexibility whereby lenders could either consider restructuring outside the purview of CDR or even initiate legal proceedings where warranted was available, banks/FIs should review all eligible cases where exposure was more than Rs 100 crore. The banks or FIs have to decide about referring the case to CDR system or proceed under the new Securitisation Act or to file a suit in Debt Recovery Tribunal, it said.RBI said accounts, which were classified as ""standard"" and ""sub-standard"" in the books of lenders, would be restructured under the first category while those classified as ""doubtful"" would be restructured under the second category.The CDR would not apply to accounts involving only one financial institution or one bank. The CDR mechanism would cover only multiple banking accounts/syndication/ consortium accounts with outstanding exposure of Rs 20 crore and above by banks and institutions."	0
"PATNA: Defence Minister George Fernandes on Thursday strongly rebutted Opposition charge of India being soft on the US in the wake of the war on Iraq saying New Delhi had time and again expressed its opposition to war against the West Asian country. ""We have time and again made it clear that we are against the war on Iraq... Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee voiced his government''s opposition to war on Iraq in both Houses of Parliament and also at the all-party meeting,"" Fernandes told reporters here.Fernandes was responding to pointed queries by media persons about whether New Delhi was siding with the US or Iraq in the war raging in the gulf and the Opposition criticism of the Vajpayee government for not coming out openly against the US.Replying to a question on the Opposition attack on the government for its failure to get a censure motion passed by Parliament against the US, he said, the motion could not be passed as consensus remained elusive.Asked if militancy in Jammu and Kashmir had increased following the war, he said, ""everybody knows infiltration increases during summer as snow melts making it easy for terrorists to cross over from Pakistan.""On the reported statement of the US Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca asking both India and Pakistan to maintain calm during the war, Fernandes said ""India never wants strained relations with its neighbours and we don''t need lessons in self-restraint from anybody.""Replying to another query, Fernandes said that nearly 250 terrorists had been killed by the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir over the past three months."	1
"AHMEDABAD: Haren Pandya's killing, though a cold-blooded murder of a high-profile political leader, may have already lost out on vital clues with its discovery some three hours after it happened. And now, with multiple agencies trying to crack it, it might turn into a case of atoo many cooksa, fear investigators.Although the central government immediately decided to hand over the investigations to the Central Bureau of Investigation, the elite agency does not appear to have many leads in the case as yet.One of their biggest disadvantages being the fact that they are on unfamiliar terrain and may have only a few local contacts, who might be forthcoming enough. On Sunday evening, CBI special director U S Misra flew in from New Delhi to oversee the progress in the investigations, and is likely to be the person in charge of the case right now, top sources in the police department told TNN.Further, the CBI is expected to set up a temporary office in the city, from where it would work on the case more independently. Dispelling doubts about Misra having flown in to make things easier for his colleagues vis-a-vis the local police, DGP K Chakravarthi was categorical in stating that athe CBI would be the lead agency handling the investigations and all information on the case would be directed to ita.Initially, the confusion in the case was further confounded with reports from Mumbai indicating that two persons who had jumped bail and holed up in Gujarat, might be involved in the murder.For this reason, the Maharashtra police was also roped into the probe. The fact that the Gujarat police had sent the names of these suspects to Mumbai, was rebutted by the former and the issue was quickly swept under the carpet.The city crime branch, which is conducting parallel investigations in the case under the supervision of deputy commissioner of police DG Vanzara, made no bones about the obvious edge it had over the central agency in terms of time, connections, and a political regime solidly behind it.Even before the 20-member CBI team started their investigations in Gujarat, the city crime branch had impounded a white Ambassador car and detained two persons who they suspected might have been involved in the execution a"" a theory which was denied by the city police commissioner a day later, as having any links with the Pandya case!And then there is the Anti-Terrorist Squad, which is quietly probing possibilities of a terrorist-militant link in the case. Barely has the investigation made progress, colleagues of the victim are already dropping clues to apossibilities of him having created enemies within the builder lobby as revenue ministera.While the hunch is that the killer was probably hired from outside Gujarat, athe main task now is to find out the local contacts who may have conducted the recce on Pandya's hauntsa, observed an IGP.From the modus operandi of the execution, it is also clear that the target was being tracked for several weeks before the killer actually pulled the trigger at a convenient time."	0
"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday brushed aside India''s assertion that its High Commission in Delhi was supporting subversive activities saying such ""allegations"" are made ""routinely.""Commenting on President APJ Abdul Kalam''s remarks on this count in his address to Parliament on Monday morning, Foreign office spokesman, Aziz Ahmed Khan said ""India continued to make baseless allegations without the obligation of substantiating them.""India ""routinely"" made such ""allegations"" but ""they shied away, they run away"", whenever challenged by Pakistan, Khan said.He reiterated Islamabad''s proposal of deploying UN observers on both sides of LoC to verify Indian claims on infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir.India, he said, does not agree to it for the fact that the ""basis for making baseless allegations will go away"".He said Pakistan seeks peaceful resolutions of all the disputes as desired by international community. ""We are not shying away from it,"" he said. In reply to a question he said it would be ""unfortunate"" if New Delhi severed diplomatic ties with Islamabad.He said dialogue and diplomatic processes were the only ""civilised"" way to conduct inter-state business and ""Pakistan certainly wants that process to go on"". Asked about the status of India-Pakistan diplomatic ties, he said ""they still exist."""	0

BATHINDA: ''Nukkad natak'' (street play) is the new weapon in a bid to control growing drug abuse among youth here. These short plays portray the traumatic life of a drug addict and the emotionally shattering experience the family of an addict has to go through.The idea is to dissuade impressionable youth from the fake glamour of drugs culture. The members of Norha Richards Art and Theatre Bathinda, a club here, are organising ''nukkad natak'' for about last two weeks.The plays provide an insight into the anguish of the drug addicts and their family members, told Mani Kant Batish, the director of the plays. Most of the artistes are in private or government service and spare about two hours daily for rehearsal and performing plays at various places in the town.Kewal, who took up the initiative for starting ''nukkad natak,'' told Times News Network that it was performed every evening between 7 pm to 8 pm at a nook or corner of a street or bazaar where they expect a good number of audience.These plays dramatise various phases in a druggist''s life, right from the time he starts taking drugs, peer group pressure, the kind of company he keep to his eventual enslavement so much so that he has to steal, beg and borrow to get drugs.They also give an inside picture of the drug mafia and their modus operandi and how they laid their network to trap the youths. Most of small-time sellers of drugs are addicts themselves who are in the business to make easy money.The battle against drugs clearly needed to be taken to the street as drug addiction has become all pervasive in Bathinda.A report prepared by a government agency revealed that above 60 per cent of the town population was hooked to one drug or the other. The maximum number of addicts are in the 26-35 age group. They constitute about 21 per cent of total drug addicts. While 15 per cent of the drug addicts are in the 36-45 age group, about 13 per cent addicts are school and college going students in the 16-25 age-group, revealed the report.	1
"NEW DELHI: In a major ruling, the Supreme Court has held that rejection of an anticipatory bail plea need not result in the arrest of the person by the investigating agency.A Bench comprising Justice N Santosh Hegde and Justice B P Singh gave this ruling while allowing appeals by some of the Directors of Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Ltd (MAPL) against an order of Bombay High Court ordering their arrest after rejection of their anticipatory bail pleas.""The mere fact that the bail applications of some of the appellants had been rejected is no ground for directing their immediate arrest,"" Justice Singh, writing for the Bench, said.A complaint was made by the Provident Fund Commissioner against Directors of MAPL, a sick company. A PIL before the High Court alleged that police was not properly investigating the complaint.The High Court, noting that their anticipatory bail pleas have been rejected, said that the only course open for the police was to arrest them. It then put Police Commissioners of Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune on notice that failure to arrest them would warrant their personal appearance before the Court.Setting aside the Judgement of the Bombay High Court, the apex Court said, ""A person whose petition for grant of anticipatory bail has been rejected may or may not be arrested by the investigating officer...aJustice Singh said the arrest of a person would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of the offence, background of the accused, the facts disclosed in the course of investigation and other relevant considerations.""In the very nature of things, a person may move the Court on mere apprehension that he may be arrested. The Court may or may not grant anticipatory bail depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case and the material placed before it,"" he said.There could be cases where the application for grant of anticipatory bail is rejected but after investigation, not enough material found against the accused to put him up for trial, he observed.Assailing the Bombay High Court order, the Bench said, ""The High Court proceeded on the assumption that since petitions for anticipatory bail had been rejected, there was no option open for the State but to arrest those persons. This assumption, to our mind, is erroneous.""In a case where, keeping all facts and circumstances in mind, an investigating officer thought it fit not to arrest the accused, the High Court had no justification to direct the same, the Bench said.Referring to settled principles of law, the Bench said even in a closure report filed by the investigating agency, the Magistrate could disagree and direct the agency to reinvestigate. However, the Magistrate cannot direct the agency to submit a report in accordance with what he thought is correct, it said."	1
BARA BANKI: Election fever has gripped the Haidergarh Assembly constituency. Candidates of most of the major parties, including Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress, are in the fray. The constituency will go to the bypolls on February 26.The campaigning is in full swing. Activists of the BSP and SP are leaving no stone unturned to ensure victory of their respective candidates at the hustings.Over 2,500 cars have been pressed into service by both the parties making mockery of norms of the Election Commission (EC). The Congress is also in the race this time.

Sitting MPs Ram Sagar Rawat and Beni Prasad Verma, general secretary of the party, have appealed to their community members to extend support to the party candidate. The SP may also gain the Muslim support in this byelections, though the Congress has fielded Imram Kidwai from here. CP Patel, candidate of the Apna Dal, is also getting a good response here.The BJP has fielded Sunder Lal Dixit, an old war horse of Haidergarh. Being a local man he enjoys support of the local populace. However, the BSP, SP and Congress candidates do not belong to Haidergarh tehsil. Being the only Brahmin candidate at the hustings, Dixit is trying to retain his party''s hold over upper caste votes. Moreover, he has support of Rajnath Singh, former chief minister. At his public meetings, Rajnath do not forget to highlight that during his regime he had launched several projects in the constituency to ensure its speedy development.The Haiderganj seat is going to the bypolls for the third time in two years. Invocation of Pota on Raghuraj Pratap Singh, independent MLA from Kunda, is a major poll issue here.

KOLKATA: Mamata Banerjee broke her silence more than 36 hours after the Cabinet reshuffle in Delhi and blamed her humble background for the missed berth.aI am sad,a she said. aNone of my achievements, during my stint as railway minister has been recognised. I did a lot to improve passenger safety and converted a number of stations into model ones but nobody mentions it now.Had I come from a 'big' family, things would have been different.a The Trinamul Congress chief claimed she had saved the exchequer lakhs of rupees since she was first elected an MP. aFrom 1992, I have always travelled economy class though I was entitled to the executive class. But it seems these things do not matter,a she rued.She again raised the railway bifurcation issue and claimed that no administrative control existed. aSafety is being ignored and employees are depressed. I am not saying this as a former railway minister but as a concerned citizen,a she said.Banerjee had earlier claimed that her views on any issue were not given importance at Cabinet meetings (when she was railway minister) as she did not have sufficient number of MPs behind her.Mamata offered to have her party's account books checked. aThere should be a probe into the source of funds of all parties. I am ready to provide all our accounts, but others should also do the same,a she said.Congress factionalism to the fore: The differences between within the state Congress came to the fore once again on Thursday, with the leaders of the Somen-Pranab faction being absent from a Youth Congress meeting to observe Gandhiji's death anniversary. While veteran leader A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury called for a revolution in West Bengal under the leadership of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the latter called upon all anti-Left secular political parties to came together before the panchayat polls.aWe do have differences, but all leaders, including Somen Mitra and Pranab Mukherjee will sit together on February 4 to make Sonia Gandhi's rally at the Brigade a success,a Das Munshi later said.	0
"LUCKNOW: It was a godsend opportunity for the state government and BJP MLC Ajit Singh, a prominent dissident leader, offered it by default. Even then, the government gave a ''go ahead'' to go all out against the mafia-turned-politician after much deliberations. The political heads were of the view that as Ajit Singh was one of the spearheads of dissident movement in the state in the recent past and as everything was calm on that frot now, any stringent action against him was likely to rake up the issue once again, atleast in the media.Another important factor which influenced the political leadership in the state in taking the final decision against Ajit was the fact that on the day of the incident, the MLC had gone to attend the Tilak ceremony of the brother of Unnao Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA itself.The fact that this particular element would highlight the proximity of some BSP MLAs with the dissidents, had led to initial reluctance on the part of the BSP think-tanks which were at work since Friday night itself.Finally, at the behest of chief minister Mayawati, it was decided that action against Ajit Singh must be initiated. But by the time the decision was taken, the MLC had enough time to ''slip away'' a"" thanks to the valuable tip-offs from his contacts in the Unnao police department. No wonder then when police raided the house of the MLC in Charbagh around 8:00 pm nothing worthwhile was found.Though the MLC''s wife was unwell, his father was the only male member of the family present in the house at the time of the raid which was more of a make-up exercise. The fact that the Unnao police took more than 12 hours before going for a crackdown gave ample time to the MLC to go underground.With the charges levelled against the MLC limited to the extent of ""attempted murder"" and the victim suffering a bruise on his head were all in favour of Ajit Singh in terms of pursuing an arrest stay. This apart, the fact that the enmity between Ajit and Akhilesh is well known and both have had quite a few exchange of fires in the recent past, was also sure to provide some leverage to him in the investigations.All said and done, the police raid at the Charbagh residence of Ajit seems to be more of an eye-wash and a potent pressure tactic of the government to ensure that the high profile MLC maintained a low profile at the political front than a strong-willed effort to arrest him for the alleged crime."	0
KOLKATA: Women in West Bengal are not inheriting land that their fathers were given under the 'Operation Barga'. The findings of a USbased Rural Development Institute survey indicated that despite laws securing the daughter's right to property, only 4.8 per cent of women inherited land in the state.This has resulted in a decline land holding by wo-men to only 4.81 lakh hectares from lakh hectares for which pattas have been issued in the past three decades.The survey team which went to various districts found as much as 64.8 per cent people saying that daughters anevera or ararelya inherited land while 21.6 per cent said daughters asometimesa inherited land.aOften daughters stated that they did not demand their share of land because they wanted to maintain a agood relationshipa with their brother. The general opinion was that sisters who demand a share of land were 'bad' or 'wicked' and that they were claiming their share of land at the expense of their brothers,a said the survey. aSeveral mothers stated that they would not want their daughters to pressurise their sons for a portion of land. They considered the idea distasteful and disrespectful,a it added.The survey claimed that married Muslim girls were more likely to inherit land than married Hindu girls. aInheritance laws in the state have reduced the land holding for women than what could have normally been achieved,a land and land reforms minister Abdur Razzak Mollah admitted to TNN.aShariyat and Mitakshara laws do not offer land to the daughter in equal proportions since the sons get twothird of the land,a he said.	0
KOLKATA: The information technology industry will be exempt from many labour and establishment laws in the forthcoming updated IT policy, indicated departmental minister Manab Mukherjee in the state Assembly on Thursday.He, however, claimed that the state would not follow the IT elitism of Andhra and Karnataka and work to bridge the adigital dividea between IT haves and have-nots.Mukherjee took a dig at Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandra Babu Naidu. aWe are slow but steady.We do not want to erect an IT tower where peasants commit suicide under its shadow,a he commented, adding, the Left Front is keen on providing 'IT to the people'.aApart from creating a conducive regulatory framework in line with the facilities extended to IT-enabled operations, this intends to include certain additional measures,a he said in his budget speech. According to him, the new measures include support to abusiness continuity planninga, really a way of declaring IT units as apublic utility servicesa. This will bar wildcat strikes in the IT sector. The exemption from other Acts will allow the IT units to employ women in night shifts and operate round-the-clock even on national holidays.Permission for self-certification and relaxation from the water and air pollution, maternity benefit and contract labour Acts would also be extended.The ITES industry has been enjoying these exemptions.The updated policy would also focus on aintensification of anti-piracy measures, introduction of data protection regulations, creation of an IT promotion cell which will act an a single-window facilitation agency for IT investmenta.Pointing to the growth of IT and ITES industries in the state and their export achievements, Mukherjee claimed that West Bengal would be one of the first three states in IT industry by 2010 and would generate revenues worth $ 10 billion in IT.He reported that the governments' consultant McKinsey had shortlisted 36 global IT majors.	1
"NEW DELHI: The Metro Rail will soon the change the profile of northeast district, home to 48 per cent of Delhi''s slums and the breeding ground of city criminals.Deputy commissioner of police (northeast), Vivek Gogia, said: ""With better employment opportunities and a facelift to the area, the crime is likely to come down."" Gogia was addressing the annual district conference.He said the Metro Rail has opened new vistas in the low-income district and will probably divert the energies of the unemployed youth to constructive things.However, he added, the DMRC is also an open challenge for the district police as quicker public movement may give cover to the criminals. The police will now have to maintain tight vigil along the Metro lines, he said.Gogia claimed that the effective policing in the district had already placed it second in terms to crime detection among the nine districts in the city.The northeast district reported about 2,832 Indian Penal Code (IPC) cases as against 3,210 last year. It claimed to have solved 1,980 cases this year. Though the district represents over 14 per cent of Delhi''s population, it accounts for six per cent of crime in the city."	0
"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala unit of the CPI-M has decided to launch an agitation under the banner of ''Adivasi Kshema Samathi'' for making land available to the landless tribals in the state, party sources said on Saturday.Talking to reporters after a two-day party state committee meeting, party state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan said the land issue was the main problem encountered by the tribals in the state and that their party would launch the stir by occupying the lands that could be distributed amongst the tribals from April 21.An Adivasi Convention would also be held as part of the stir at Kozhikode on April 16, he said. Vijayan alleged that Congress had always been deceitful towards the cause of tribals, which led to the Muthanga incident in which police had to resort to firing.Demanding a judicial probe into the ""atrocities"" meted out to LDF workers during the SP office march on March 17, Vijayan said it was the responsibility of the Government to bring out the truth.Criticising Chief Minister AK Antony for justifying police action on LDF leaders, Vijayan alleged that the police acted with the knowledge and consent of the Chief Minister.As part of LDF campaign to expose ""police atrocities'' and omissions of the UDF Government, three zonal rallies would be held from April 7 to 12, he said."	1

HYDERABAD: G Siva Kumar of Vijayawada with 151 marks in the engineering stream and M Hitesh Reddy of Guntur with 158 marks in the medical stream topped Eamcet 2003, the results of which were released on Saturday. Students from colleges in coastal Andhra did particularly well, taking seven of the top 10 ranks in either stream. Just four marks separated the top tenners in the medical exam (158-154) and five (151-146) in the engineering.Releasing the results, technical education minister N Anjaneyulu said girls fared better than boys in the exam, although only three girls figured in the top 10 of either list. Of the 1,70,000 who took the exam on April 26, 89,743 qualified for seats in the engineering colleges (62,000 seats) and 33,866 for medical college. The minister announced that all students who attempted question number 156 in the engineering exam were awarded a mark as the question had two answers. Similarly all students who attempted questions no. 11, 120, 133, 135 were deemed to have answered them correctly. Students have to pay Rs 500 for revaluation and Rs 1000 for getting a xerox photocopy of their answersheets, he said. While the top rankers and their respective tutorial colleges celebrated, the results and indeed the examination itself were contested by some colleges. Kakatiya Academy director M Srinivasulu Naidu announced that he would challenge the final key in court as answers to question nos. 42 and 61 in the zoology test were 'wrong'. Vignan Educational Institutions director L Rathaiah urged to scrap the very Eamcet system and alter the admission procedures of engineering and medicine colleges to make them similar to those followed by degree colleges. Any student could get a minimum of 43 marks in engineering by blindly ticking option 'A' to all questions, while the minimum qualifying mark was just 30 per cent.	0
"PATNA: The state Congress has showered lavish praise on Union railway minister, Nitish Kumar, for the steps taken by him for the development of railways in the state.""The people of Mithilanchal will always remember Nitish Kumar as ''Vikas Purush'' (man of development) for the historic step taken by him in getting a bridge across Kosi in Nirmali passed and the foundation stone laid by the PM"", said the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson, Kripanath Pathak.Thanking the PM and Kumar for initiating the construction of the rail bridge which was washed away in 1934, Pathak said that the absence of the bridge virtually split Mithilanchal in two parts.

"NEW DELHI: Heroin is the first choice among drug abusers in Delhi. In fact, in the top ten chart, it has improved its position over the past five years, replacing the old college favourite Cannabis. In an ongoing survey of over 37,000 patients seeking treatment at the National Drug Dependency Treatment Centre (NDDTC) at AIIMS, a shocking picture of a city addicted to narcotics, emerges.""Heroin has emerged as the number one choice among addicts for the past five years, almost 50 per cent of those surveyed are heroin addicts,"" says Dr Ranjit Ray, head of the department, NDDTC. What is also worrying is that unlike public perception of heroin addicts as homeless vagrants on the street, it is the middle class which makes up most of its numbers.""We have patients who are clerks, ushers in cinema halls, insurance agents who have addresses, homes and perhaps even bank loans against their name, who are in the heroin net,"" he says. ""Heroin is an expensive habit, the homeless cannot support it,"" he adds.Another trend which is emerging from this survey is that ordinary medical products are being used by substance abusers to get a high. ""Ordinary pain killers like Proxyvon and anti-anxiety pills like Calmpose are being used extensively. Around 4000 patients are those who fell in this multiple drug use category,"" adds Ray.Of the 37,000 patients, 5,500 are new patients at NDDTC, 25,000 are old patients who had been continuing treatment, and about 7,000 patients are from the two community clinics run by AIIMS.Apart from Heroin, IDU or Injectible Drug Use is also high. ""What staggers is the fact that 8000 patients out of those surveyed use IDUs, of which 5 per cent turned out to be HIV positive,"" he said. All IDUs are put through a screening process for HIV when they come in for treatment.The most dangerous category is that of alcoholics. Alcoholics mostly sign up at community centres, however, they are not seeking help in an organised manner."	0

"LUCKNOW: After the World War II ended, a young boy asked his mother, ""Ma, will I also have to go and kill people when I grow up?"" The mother could not think of a suitable answer to satisfy the curiosity of her son. However, the reality of animosity among nations and the subsequent massacres that followed in the world wars were a turning point for the mother. So persuasive was the answer in her mind to such a scenario, that the mother, Dr Dorris Loren, a psychologist based in United States, founded the Children's International Summer Village (CISV). Dr Loren was firm in her conviction that children were the future of the country, hence the fate of their respective nations lay in the hands of children. As part of the CISV activity, camps are organised, where children of different nationalities are brought together under one roof. This helps break down psychological barriers and children get to understand the uniqueness in each other. Dr Loren passed away last year, but her concept of bringing about international peace and unity continues to inspire people around the world. CISV camps are being held in every country with the CISV headquarters based at New Castle upon River Tyne, England. In Lucknow, CISV camps are being hosted at City Montessori School for the past eight years. During the camp, the participants are explained concepts of world unity, peace and equality of mankind. A variety of activities and games are organised by the managing staff of the camp to apprise children about the different cultures, food habits, languages and lifestyles of different countries."	0
PATIALA: The Bhakhra Bias Management Board (BBMB) has issued high alert to the Punjab authorities to meet the eventuality of sudden increase in the water flow in Satluj river due to the prospective heavy rainfall in the catchment upstream areas of the river, sources said here on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the BBMB has increased the water discharge from Bhakhra from 31,000 cusecs to 33,000 cusecs from Tuesday in anticipation of good monsoon and also to meet the power requirement of the region.Sources said there is also a possibility that the BBMB may have to increase the discharge up to 38,000 cusecs if there is good monsoon in the upper catchment areas.A senior engineer of the Punjab State Electricity Board told TNN here on Wednesday that this step would be very necessary to avoid the eventuality of spillage at Bhakhra Dam in case the reservoir level touched the high limit of 1,680 feet. At present the water level at the Bhakhra Dam is 1,597 feet. He said there was no need to be panicky as it was a routine matter. At present the inflow of water into Bhakhra dam reservoir Gobind Sagar is around 15,000 cusecs but the bumper rain in upper catchment areas can increase the inflow up to 50,000 cusecs.Punjab has experienced flash floods twice in the recent past and out of them, one was due to spillage at the Bhakhra Dam. In 1993 the floods came due to heavy rain in early July while in 1988 it was due to increased water level in the Bhakhra reservoir.During the present season, till now the snow melting has become boon for the PSEB in meeting the requirement of farming sector. Due to the snow melting in upper hill areas of Satluj, the Bhakhra Dam reservoir had attained a sufficient amount of water and helped the PSEB in reducing the power cuts.On the other hand, water level in Ranjit Sagar Dam is 14 meter higher than the level of last year.	0
NEW DELHI: Union law minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday expressed concern over courts asking journalists to disclose their sources in contempt proceedings. At a seminar on the use of law as an instrument of harassment of mediapersons, Jaitley said legislative intervention is needed on the use of the contempt law. But the impact of such a legislation would have to be assessed before it is enacted, he added.Jaitley said the immunity against disclosing sources was limited to the forum of the Press Council of India. He added it was recommended in the 1982 Mathew Commission report which touched upon the issue of freedom of speech and expression of media vis-a-vis the judiciary.He said laws were evolving and there was no need to strengthen the defamation law. He suggested an in-house mechanism to tackle media criticism of issues concerning the judiciary.	0
SRINAGAR: The health sector in Kashmir is faced with the problem of unregulated flow of sub-standard and spurious drugs to 1,800 unregistered medical stores.According to sources, doctors and fake drug companies are working hand-in-glove. Drug department officials, doctors and chemists have been trading charges over the dangerous trade.Of the 2,100 medical shops in the Valley, only 300 are registered with the office of the drug controller.A druggist, Habibullah Lone of Haftchinar, blames the drug controller for the delay in grant of licences to chemists. Lone's application for a licence is pending with the office of the drug controller since 1976.The Valley's market is inundated with spurious Crocin, Taxim-O, Ocid, Ciprobid, Sporidex and Ceftum. Various fake companies, sources said, fix a deal with the doctors in the Valley for prescribing spurious medicines to their patients.According to sources, wards of some doctors are being paid capitation fee for admission in private medical colleges in lieu of prescription of sub-standard drugs.A well-known doctor in the Valley was recently offered by a fake company a car, two refrigerators and a free family tour of Kolkata, sources claimed.While the pharmaceutical dealers blame the doctors for promotion of sub-standard, spurious drugs in the Valley, the government holds the former responsible for imports of spurious drugs from Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and UP.President of Chemists and Druggists Association Mustaq Ahmad Geelani charged the government with harassing genuine chemists. Recently, the deputy commissioner of Srinagar seized genuine medicines worth crores of rupees from several city shops without proper verification, he alleged.On the other hand, some doctors alleged that the office of drug controller is involved in the sale of spurious drugs. They stressed the need to establish a drug laboratory to test the medicines.	0
PATNA: Both the Houses of state legislature remained paralysed on Monday as a determined opposition pressed for adjournment motion over the police firings in the state after the fake police encounter at Ashiana Nagar here.In both the Houses, adjournment motions were rejected by the presiding officers, which led to disruption in the proceedings. The state legislative council was adjourned in the pre-lunch session by chairman Jabir Hussain following a din over charges and counter-charges levelled by the opposition and ruling party benches on the issue of kidnapping and adeterioratinga law and order situation.When the House proceedings started, NDA leaders moved an adjournment motion on the issue of aincreasing incidence of kidnapping and poor law and order situationa.The chairman refused to accept the adjournment motion as the House was to take up the debate over the motion of thanks on the governor's speech at the joint session of both the Houses. The NDA MLAs moved into the well of the assembly raising slogans against the government as soon as the House assembled for the day. Even as Speaker Sadanand Singh announced the commencement of question hour, the NDA MLAs entered the well of the House raising slogans like aLathi goli ki sarkar, nahi chalegi, nahi chalegia.The CPI(ML) members also entered the well demanding action against the junior minister for agriculture for allegedly killing their party worker in Siwan. Interestingly, the first question on the agenda of the House was on a series of afakea police encounters in the state. The Speaker had to adjourn the House till 12 noon. When the House reassembled, the NDA leaders asked the Speaker about their adjournment motion. The Speaker stressed that the adjournment motion could not be taken up before the motion of thanks on the governor's speech.However, leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi , quoting experts on parliamentary proceedings, said that there was a precedence of an adjournment motion being taken up on the very day of the President's address. He was supported by the leaders of Samata Party and JD(U) groups, Umashankar Prasad Singh and Ganesh Prasad Yadav respectively. CPI(ML) MLA Raja Ram Singh stressed that the Speaker must use his discretion and allow the motion because an extraordinary situation prevails in the state where innocent people are being killed by the police. Parliamentary affairs minister Ram Chandra Purbey opposed the move, saying that the opposition was free to raise these issues during the debate on the motion of thanks.The Speaker rejected the adjournment motion, which led to disruption in the proceedings again followed by adjournment of the House till the post-lunch period. In the post-lunch session of the assembly, proceedings continued to be disrupted. Amidst the din, Dasai Choudhary and Vinod Kumar Yadavendu initiated the process for vote of thanks on the governor's address before the House was adjourned. Speaking to mediapersons, Modi said the opposition did not raise the matter during the question hour because it wanted the adjournment motion to be approved. aThe adjournment motion is like a censure motion against the government,a he remarked.	1
"MUMBAI: It was fitting that the Rashtrapati from Rameswaram delivered the first memorial lecture for the Capitalist from Chorwad.At a sombre event to mark the first death anniversary of Dhirubhai Ambani, founder of the Reliance group, President A.P.J.Abdul Kalam, ensconced in Dhirubhai's trademark redleather chair, was the sun in a galaxy of political firepower comprising three chief ministers, two Union ministers and a former finance minister.With Amitabh Bachchan as the distinguished master of ceremonies, the shock-and-awe line-up was complete.The Jamshed Bhabha Opera House sold out faster than a Broadway musical on opening night as Bollywood stars, Mumbai's glitterati, bizerati and politicos of every stripe showed up in their Sunday best to honour the memory of the man whom Mr Bachchan called India's afirst capitalist''. Commenting on the bio-diversity in the audience, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, said it sent out the message that aall Indians had united to honour Dhirubhai''.Mr Bachchan's baritone set the tone for the morning when he quoted from William Blake and said that Dhirubhai had the vision to see the world in a grain of sand.President Kalam, with his impish sense of humour, said that he taken his task of delivering the first memorial lecture very seriously and had prepared for it by areading many books'' and aeven going to the Internet''.His lecture, 'Growth is Life', was illustrated with two couplets by the classical Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar. A true leader, he noted,would always defeat problems and never be defeated by them. aDhirubhai Ambani gave problems to problems,'' quipped Mr Kalam.Speaker after speakera""and there were a dozen of thema"" outdid each other to pay tribute to a man variously described as dreamer, leader and innovator. Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi announced that Dhirubhai's village Chorwad had finally been connected to the Narmada with awater pipes so big that even our Amitabhji can walk through them''. Maharashtra's CEO Sushilkumar Shinde named July 6 'Young Entrepreneurs' Day', while Mulayam Singh Yadav declared that if not in his lifetime then in death at least Dhirubhai deserved the Bharat Ratna.Madhya Pradesh CM Digvijay Singh, whose most-visited eating joint in the city is the Ambani dining room at Seaview, reiterated his close relationship with the family.Other speakers included Chhagan Bhujbal, Murli Manohar Joshi, Manmohan Singh and and liberalisation's poster boy Arun Shourie, who did not disappoint (See box).After the tribute-fest, the President wondered aloud how Dhirubhai would have reacted to the fulsome praise. aI thought about it,'' he said, aAnd I realised that he would smile.''Although Mr Kalam had never met Dhirubhai in person, Anil Ambani, who gave the vote of thanks, recalled that fate had intervened to allow the two pioneers to have a long-distance conversation during which his father had shared his ideas with the President for making India an aeconomic superpower''."	0

"MUMBAI: Next week will mark one year since the word Godhra charred its way into our lives, earning for itself a prime spot in India''s directory of communal strife.Among the many peace initiatives being held across the country to mark the anniversary is a series of poetry readings and workshops organised by the Vishendevi Youth Media Centre, a small group started by writer Anju Makhija.The multi-lingual poetry session will be held tomorrow at Mani Bhavan at 4:30 p.m., where children who have interacted with Pakistani students and older poets who have written on communal harmony will read their poems.Among the older poets are Urdu poet Aftab Ajmeri and Sindhi poet Nand Jhaveri, who''s often visited Pakistan after Partition.While poetry is a medium that leads to introspection, the performance of a play called ''Bomb Blast'' at two schools led to quite an explosion of emotion. The play, put up by students, was a satire on a jingoistic scientist who builds a bomb and an oily minister who blithely declares that he will drop the bomb on the enemy if the need arises. Though not in itself incendiary, the play caused a delayed explosion when the discussion moved from the glorification of the bomb to loud declarations of how it should be dropped on Pakistan if India was threatened.This Indo-Pak talk led inevitably to the Hindu-Muslim relationship, an issue which has become the subtext for any discussion on peace in the country.The reactions from the two schools, both with differing demographics, was indicative of many thingsa""of how boys and girls react differently, how poor children who live in slums and are exposed to the daily attrition of violence react to abstract issues like peace, how children from minority communities react, how children in general like to shut the pain out. When the girls in a Muslim-dominated school were asked what had started the Gujarat carnage, all were silent and a few said, ""Bhuj.""While the girls talked sweetly of making a ""love bomb"", the boys talked of ""pouring kerosene on ''them''. But then, in the midst of all this anger were the words of wisdom from the mouths of babesa""a child stood up and told his companion that instead of pouring kerosene on others he should put a block of ice on his head to cool down.""I think that was such excellent advice,"" says Ms Makhija. ""And if you think of it, Indian heritage provides us with that block of ice for the minda""I''m talking about yoga. If yoga was taught in school, it would go a long way towards building up tolerance."""	1

AHMEDABAD: An unarmed head constable posted in Sankheda taluka of Vadodara district was arrested on Friday for demanding and accepting bribe from a bootlegger.As per the complaint lodged with the Anti-Corruption Bureau by the bootlegger, Ramesh Tadvi, constable Laxmansinh Vanzara used to take Rs 1,000 from him every month for allowing him to continue his bootlegging business.However, a couple of months ago, Vanzara 'hiked' his rates and demanded Rs 2,000 from Tadvi.When the complainant refused, Vanzara filed cases against him under the Prohibition Act. Tadvi claims that Vanzara also began threatening and pressurising him to pay the 'hiked' sum from this month onwards, otherwise he would stop Tadvi's business and book him under Pasa. Finally, the sum was bargained down to Rs 1,500 but Tadvi lodged a complaint with the ACB and a trap was laid at the Sankheda bus station. Vanzara was caught red-handed accepting the money.	0
"WASHINGTON: The Pentagon is preparing to build a controversial earth-penetrating nuclear weapon five times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, which could be aimed at North Korea''s underground nuclear and missile facilities, as also a low-yield nuclear warhead, senior US administration officials were quoted as saying on Friday.The preliminary tests for the new generation nuclear weapons will soon begin, the officials said.Pentagon will recommend to Congress the building of the ''earth penetrator'' and has sent this week documents that, if approved, could lift an eight-year-old Congressional restriction on development of a ""low- yield nuclear warhead,"" which is warhead below five kilotons. The Air Force report, to be delivered to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, said The Washington Post, will state the military requirements for the ""robust nuclear earth penetrator,"" a device designed to dig in to the ground before it explodes and crushes any facility buried beneath it.Five times more powerful than the device detonated at Hiroshima, the bomb would have an even greater impact because a nuclear weapon''s force is multiplied when its shock wave penetrates the rocky crust of the earth. Everet Beckner, deputy head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, told Congress on Thursday an estimated USD 21 mn is expected to be spent in 2004 for these weapons.He told the House Strategic Forces Subcommittee that the administration was certain to continue theoretical and design work on one or more of such new-age weapons."	1

"WASHINGTON: The $3-billion aid package was only a third of what Pakistan wanted and half of what it expected. The US President bluntly rejected pleas for F-16s fighter planes and suo motu raised the issue of democracy in Pakistan. And American officials made it clear the aid was contingent on Pakistan treading a straight and narrow path on non-proliferation and terrorism.Not exactly a meeting of hearts and minds, you''d think.But for Pakistan''s military ruler Pervez Musharraf, it was day in the sun in more ways than one. The first South Asian ruler -- and only among the half a dozen worldwide -- to be invited by George Bush to the Presidential retreat at Camp David, Musharraf reveled in the outing, looking as fit and relaxed as his host on a warm summer day on which the temperature touched 92 deg F (33 deg C). The two men emerged from their 90-minute meeting to address the media dressed almost identically -- tie-less and wearing light jackets -- while spouses Laura Bush and Sehba Musharraf repaired to discuss other matters. From their easy exchanges it was evident that Bush liked Musharraf; his problem was not with the military man but the policies he had pursued or not pursued. ""President Musharraf is a courageous leader and a friend of the United States,"" Bush gushed, despite having reminded him about the need for greater democracy in Pakistan. ""He''s working to build a modern Pakistan that is tolerant and prosperous.""Musharraf too was all simpering exuberance and not even Bush''s subtle rebuke on the extremist path Pakistan chose to travel -- and now promised to reverse -- could dampen his enthusiasm.""I am extremely grateful, particularly honoured and touched by his special gesture in arranging our meeting in Camp David... especially on a Tuesday,"" he gloated. ""This is certainly a typical example of his warmth and cordiality towards me as a person and towards Pakistan.""A senior administration official involved in the meeting later told reporters that the atmosphere was very cordial, very friendly and the two men ""genuinely like and respect each other"".There were a number of subliminal and nuanced messages in the remarks by the two men. Bush, for instance, praised the ""industry and the talents of Pakistani Americans"", a sorely needed balm considering his homeland security department has devastated the lives of many innocent workaday Pakistanis in US.The Musharraf regime has been criticised for not being sensitive to the plight of US-based Pakistanis, including many white collar professionals, who have suffered because of their home country extremist reputation fostered by the military. Musharraf in turn tried to gamely pin down Bush on the F-16 issue and the purported threat from India outlined by a reporter, kidding, ""You are never going to escape this (question).""But at the end of the day, the enduring image remained of two men who were comfortable with each other even if their establishments distrusted each other. Gen Musharraf clearly remains Washington''s favourite dictator."	1
MUMBAI: The investigating officer in the case against Bharat Shah and others charged with aiding underworld activities told the special court on Tuesday that he had identified gangster Chhota Shakeel's voice in the intercepted conversation.Investigating officer of the case assistant police commissioner Shankar Kamble who was in the witness stand described the role played by Shah, film producer Nazim Rizvi and two other accused in the conspiracy hatched by Karachi-based gangster Chhota Shakeel to target film personalities for extortion.In response to questions asked by public prosecutor Rohini Salian, Mr Kamble, the 74th witness to depose, said that in 2000 some senior police officers had a meeting to discuss ways of controlling the rise in underworld activities in the city.Mr Kamble said the police found that three Dubai-based numbers were being used by Shakeel to keep in touch with his henchmen in Mumbai. He said after getting permission from the police commissioner to intercept calls he had recorded 33 telephonic talks between Shakeel and film personalities including one with Shah, Rizvi, Sanjay Dutt, Mahesh Manjrekar, Sanjay Gupta and Harish Sughand.Earlier, fourteen witnesses including film personalities, Sanjay Dutt, Mahesh Manjrekar, Sanjay Gupta and Rakesh Roshan had turned hostile by not supporting the prosecution's case.Mr Kamble said police inspector Sunil Temkar had identified Shakeel's voice in one of the interceptions. He said that as he had twice had a lengthy conversation with Shakeel he too identified the gangster's voice. He said the taped conversations revealed that Shakeel was in constant touch with Rizvi.In the deposition which would continue on Wednesday, Mr Kamble said the intercepted talks also revealed that Shakeel was trying to take over'' he film industry and had threatened a number of film personalities. He said some money had also been transferred from Mumbai to Dubai and received by Shakeel.	0
"NEW Delhi: Disagreeing with the Government''s ""dogmatic"" policy on Iraq, senior VHP leader Praveen Togadia on Saturday said India''s economic and civilisational interest lay in adopting a pro-American stand.Togadia, who had stirred a hornet''s nest with his earlier statement supporting US and forced VHP to disown it, charged the Government with ""repeating the Gujral doctrine"" which led to the displacement of thousands of Indians from the Gulf during the previous war.""Foreign policy should not be dogmatic. Iraq today owes us 120 million US dollars. We have one oil well. Finally, George Bush will have his say and post-war there will be an economic boom.

HYDERABAD: Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Y S R a -jasekhara Reddy has asked Dwcra groups to corner the government during the forthcoming 'Mahila-Rythu' Janmabhoomi for failing to fulfil the promises made during the previous grama sabhas.The CLP leader, in a statement issued here on Sunday, asked the Dwcra groups to demand the government to release the revolving fund to all self-help groups, who had completed six months, pay salaries to anganwadi workers and also put pressure on the Centre to reduce the price of cooking gas.Reddy accused chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu of making false promises to women only to gain votes. Stating that Naidu had transformed the state into a 'Madhyam Andhra Pradesh' with the indiscriminate issue of licences to liquor shops, the CLP leader asked Naidu to waive tax on gas cylinders. He ridiculed the chief minister for promising cell phones to Dwcra women, while the latter were demanding marketing facilities for their products.Reddy demanded that the government refrain from collecting 15 per cent interest on loans to Dwcra groups, while the groups were only being paid three per cent interest on their deposits.The CLP leader recalled that Naidu had not fulfiled any of the promises made to women prior to the 1999 elections that include four lakh house-sites, 40,000 ration shops, revolving fund to Dwcra groups, 1.5 lakh old-age pensions, girl child scheme, free education for girls and banks.	0

This was neither new nor as dramatic as the 213 Bangladeshi snakecharmers who had found themselves similarly sandwiched between a section of belligerent BSF jawans on one side and equally hostile jawans of Bangladesh Rifles.But the media did highlight the couple's desperate plea for 'mercy killing' after being forced to live in the open for nearly a week, with no access to either food or water.While both the BSF and the BDR highlighted the case as the handiwork of the other, the couple disappeared into the morning mist , after a week-long standoff in North Dinajpur, as mysteriously as the snake charmers had melted away from Coochbehar district's Satgachi border earlier in the month. With the war of words hotting up and with both the BSF and the BDR claiming to have outsmarted the other, the real issue has got buried.Poor Bangladeshis travelling to India in search of livelihood, influx of persecuted minorities from Bangladesh and movement of both Indian and Bangladeshi smugglers have all been painted with the same brush. They are all described as 'infiltrators', armed men coming surreptitiously for subversion. Respective national interest has cast a shadow on human rights, comments Ratneswar Bhattacharjee, a scholar on Bangladesh affairs. aAll cry for human rights have stopped at the no man's land.aObservers, however, have found a method in the madness. Elections in both countries, they feel, are responsible for raising the pitch. Till recently, claim these observers, Bangladesh and BDR rarely objected to Bangladeshis being sent back by India. But the Khaleda Zia-Jamat government decided to resist the push backs with an eye on the upazilla polls in Bangladesh, claims a BSF official. Recently held Assembly election in Tripura and upcoming panchayat elections in West Bengal, slated for May this year, might similarly have prompted West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to tacitly toe the line of the NDA government at the Centre.Although the state BJP ideologue Sabyasachi Bagchi accepts that the national growth rate of Indian Muslims from 9.9 per cent in 1951 to 12 per cent in 2001 is 'normal', he vents his fear of millions of Bangladeshis swamping the Hindus and pave the way for a greater Bangladesh. Uncharacteristically, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has maintained a studied silence on the issue.His proximity to the deputy prime minister and BJP hardliner, Lal Krishna Advani, embarrasses his colleagues in the Left Front. The frequency with which BJP leaders have ben quoting Bhattacharjee on the 'minority issue' has also made squirm. Bangladeshi diplomats, however, recall that Bhattacharjee had expressed worries the Tripura poll as CPM's were being killed by tribal insurgents, and also about the separatist 'Kamtapuris' in North Bengal when the Bangladesh's foreign minister called on him month.aBangladeshis travelling to India in search of livelihood, influx of minorities from Bangladesh and movement of Indian and Bangladeshi smugglers have all been painted infiltrators - armed men coming for subversion.aBJP accepts the national growth rate of Muslims is 'normal', but it vents fear millions of Bangladeshis swamping the Hindus and pave the way for a greater Bangladesh.	1
"VADODARA: Deputy mayor Shailesh Sotta Mehta finally put his papers down after a district court decision, headed by extra assistant judge K I Kachia, here turned down his plea on issuing a stay over the no-confidence motion initiated by the BJP-led board against him in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC).The matter has been lying pending in the district court since April 19, when the municipal board placed a requisition in the general board.The court, in its verdict quoting rule 6(5) of section 457 of the Bombay Provisional Municipal Corporation (BPMC) Act, mentions, ""No direct ''vote of no confidence'' shall be moved unless notice of it is given to the councillors of the general meeting through an agenda, at least, one week in advance of the date in which the vote of no confidence is to be moved.""Senior officials in the VMC, however, say that the rule does not mention as to who could be removed by calling a no-confidence motion.""I placed my resignation as soon as I heard the decision,"" says Shailesh Sotta Mehta.""The BJP''s demand that should have resigned on moral grounds finds no mention in the BPMC Act and their case rests on loose ground,"" adds Mehta.BJP insiders privately admit that Mehta''s resignation has sparked off a race for the now vacant seat with both Dilip Kothari and Suresh Rajput in the fray for the coveted post. They further add that according to an agreement between the contending candidates and the BJP, Kothari would hold the post for the new term in October, while Rajput is supposed to hold it in the following year.However, sources say that senior members of the BJP, like former BJP city unit president K K Shah, BJP spokesman Nalin Bhatt, and MP Jaya Thakker are against Kothari and Rajput holding the post as their alignment with the BJP as Independent candidates has been mired with controversies."	1
"AHMEDABAD: Memories of the earth-quake two years back came back to haunt Amdavadis on Wednesday morning when housing quarters of fire brigade personnel at Jamalpur began ""trembling"".The dreaded rattle of utensils cou-pled with flower vases dropping from shelves and from atop television sets, as if swiped by an invisible force, sent a wave of panic across the city as hun-dreds gathered to see for themselves this bizarre phenomenon.The mysterious vibrations lasted for more than three hours as a deputy collector from the district collectorate and Ahmedabad Fire Brigade (AFB) personnel rushed to the spot to take stock. Barring a few cracks on walls of houses, there was no other damage or casualty.It all began around 9.30 am, when firemen with their families in tow rushed out of the 50-odd houses that are located right behind the Jamalpur fire station.Later, around 3.45 pm, another vi-bration lasting for five minutes was felt at the same location. Senior fire-men including the chief fire officer Bipin Jadeja rushed to the spot. These tremors were felt mostly in the single-storey structures. Walls of these three houses shook perceptibly, raising a din as beds, chairs and other household goods trembled to the shocks.Niruben Bhagora, wife of fireman Narsinhbhai Bhagora, recounted ""We rushed out of our quarters as we felt the earth trembling."" Bhagora''s fresh-ly repaired quarter has developed a crack in one of the rooms after Wednesday''s tremors.But, the effect was lesser on the two low rises in the same premises. The alarm raised by the residents drew people out of houses. The boundary wall, however, did seem to be in grip of this strange vibration.Divisional fire officer M F Dastoor said, ""These RCC structures which are more than two-decade-old were re-paired meticulously after being dam-aged by the earthquake in 2001. The cause of these vibrations has not been identified as yet.""Later, the AMC commissioner P Panneervel reached Jamalpur right on time to feel another mysterious vi-bration in the evening. ""I felt the vi-brations myself. Experts have been called to throw light on this phenome-non,"" said Panneervel.A team of officials, including a geol-ogist from the district collectorate, led by city deputy collector Gaurav Pra-japati reached the spot soon after the second vibration. Prajapati said, ""Ex-perts along with a seismograph have been called from Rajkot to investi-gate."" A fortnight back, a similar vibra-tion in a school at Harni in Vadodara had created panic and had to be evac-uated.Similar tremors, along with mysterious blasts, have been reported in a wide area in and around Rajkot in Saurashtra for the last couple of months which has so far remained un-explained despite the presence of nu-merous teams of experts."	0
"MUMBAI: BJP''s three-day ''chintan baithak'' brainstorm session here appears to have endorsed Prime Minister Vajpayee''s suggestion to contest the next Lok Sabha poll on the issue of development (''vikas'') and not national security.How to gear the organisation for the coming round of five assembly and the next Lok Sabha polls by showcasing the BJP-led NDA coalition''s achievements, with a stress on programmes developed for the poor, was the central theme at the session, it is learnt. The party plans to seek a mandate to re-elect the BJP to enable the party to complete the work.Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s speech at the conclusion of the conclave indicated the leadership controversy had been put aside; he asked everyone to work under Vajpayee for a win in the next polls. And though he spoke on national security, Advani chose to stress the importance of the development issue. The party also made clear its conviction of Hindutva being an integral part of the BJP ideology. ""We are of the opinion that a beautiful Ram temple must be constructed at Ayodhya. What modalities to adopt should be chosen by the government,"" party president Venkaiah Naidu said."	1
"<div class=""section1""><div class=""Normal"">NEW YORK: With war seemingly imminent in the Gulf, the US has prepared a list of several senior Iraqi officials, including Saddam Hussein''s two sons, who would be tried for war crimes or crimes against humanity after an American-led attack on Iraq, a senior American official was quoted as saying.<br /><br />In addition to Hussein himself, the list includes members of his inner circle who sit atop a hierarchy of 2,000 members of the Iraqi elite who were previously identified by the American intelligence agencies.But only now are the names of the top group being made public, the <span style="""" font-style:="""" italic="""">New York Times </span>reported.<br /><br />Administration officials were quoted as saying that they had planned to send the list of people to Baghdad with a delegation from the Arab League with hopes of persuading the men to leave the country with Hussein as way to avoid a war.

"NEW DELHI: The government went on a spending spree on Saturday. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) cleared a slew of welfare schemes worth thousands of crore of rupees. Many of these schemes were pending for months. They were taken up in a bunch by the CCEA on the eve of the PM''s China visit.In a follow-up to the PM''s Independence Day announcement, the CCEA approved an additional Rs 700 crore for three schemes for improving drinking water supply in rural India.To promote industry and tourism in north-eastern states, the CCEA cleared Rs 175 crore to Indian Airlines subsidiary, Alliance Air, during 2002-07 for running additional flights.It approved an outlay of Rs 250 crore in the 10th plan to provide impetus to population stabilisation efforts in the eight states lagging behind in reaching the family planning goals.It approved another programme assisted by the UN Population Fund that aims to support country''s goal of population stabilisation at national and state levels at a cost of Rs 365 crore.The CCEA also cleared two special programmes under the Rashtriya Shram Vikas Yojna for Bihar and the Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput districts in Orissa. These two programmes will cost Rs 1,200 crore.It rounded up its welfare concerns with a decision to provide a hike in the the MSP for the jute growers. The main TD-5 grade jute will fetch a MSP of Rs 860 per quintal, up Rs 10 for the 2003-04 season.Under the PM''s drinking water programme, three schemes were approved: Installation of 1 lakh hand pumps in water-scarce areas, drinking water in one lakh primary schools in rural areas and revival of one lakh traditional sources of drinking water.""The implementation of the schemes would require an additional Rs 700 crore to be released in two tranches of Rs 350 crore each in two years,"" said an official spokesperson."	1
"<div class=""section1""><div class=""Normal"">AHMEDABAD: Two days before Haren Pandya was killed, the Gujarat police had received information about two sharpshooters having sneaked into Ahmedabad. But they failed to act on this bit of crucial intelligence.<br /><br />This slip-up was revealed by state home secretary K Nityanandam on Thursday, at an informal meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani during his visit here.Nityanandam, who is a police officer on deputation to the secretariat, said that intelligence had been received that two sharpshooters, Rafiq and Jameel, had arrived in the city.<br /> <br />Advani had earlier revealed that Central intelligence agencies had told him that there were celebrations in the underworld after Pandya's death. The underworld had also said that although their prime target was protected by security, a very important target, as in Pandya, had been done away with. <br /><br />Also present at the meeting were director-general of Gujarat police K Chakravarthi, Ahmedabad police chief K R Kaushik and Union minister Arun Jaitley, among others. <br /><br />The information about the arrival of the sharpshoooters was passed on to the CID-crime department of the Gujarat police. What the department did with the information is not known. The source of the intelligence is also unknown, but presumably it was the Mumbai police.<br />Analysts point out that Haren Pandya did not figure in the threat perception of the police, and therefore, when this intelligence was received, nobody thought that a security cover should be extended to him.<br /><br />''Unfortunately, the official apparatus has been concerned mostly with Narendra Modi and his security arrangement. It failed to appreciate the danger to Pandya and he was a sitting duck,'' said a source. He added: ''Every time such intelligence is received, the chief minister's security is upgraded.''<br /><br />It is clear now that Pandya was shot dead by a hired killer sent by the underworld, but at whose behest is not yet known. ''The real issue is who gave the <span style="""" font-style:="""" italic="""">supari</span> and why,'' said a police officer. <br /><br />Analysts aver that the hired assassin may have fled the state by now.

"KOLKATA: The death of a stabbing victim sparked mob fury at The Assembly of God Church Hospital on Sunday. According to OC, Park Street police station, Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, five persons were arrested for damaging hospital property and rioting.The hospital authorities said that Mansur Ali, 38, was admitted there on Friday night after he and his fellow businessman Tasvir Ahmed Khan were stabbed at Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road in the New Market police station area.Both had multiple wounds in their backs.

"SHIMLA: The youth are not happy with the state of affairs in the state and are taking the pre-poll promises of different parties with a pinch of salt.By and large, they have three grievances. One, industries are dying in the state and there are very few jobs. Two, they find casteism worrying and say there are fewer jobs for the unreserved categories because of the quota policy.And three, even basic facilities like roads, water and power are lacking in the state.The youth are not happy with the level of campaigning by political parties, which are making personal allegations to win votes. They want a government which would make day-to-day living less of a struggle.Says Tilak Raj, a student of Himachal Pradesh University, ""The political leaders know they won''t fulfil their promises of stability, development and peace. But they talk about these things before very election. Being a student, my main concern is employment opportunities. Industries are dying in Himachal and young people like me don''t know what to do after graduation.""Sunil and Naresh, students of Kortshera College, also find the lack of job opportunities frustrating. ""Himachal is crying out for development. Casteism looms large over everyday business. Only people of the reserved categories are getting benefits because of the reservation policy.

BATHINDA: Thousands of students of Punjab Technical University (PTU) are in a quandary following cancellation of nine papers after leakage of question papers in different towns of Punjab and Rajasthan. They have no official information about the papers that have been cancelled nor they have been issued a new date sheet.A report published in The Times of India on March 31 about the leakage of nine papers by a racket spreading over Punjab and Rajasthan before the start of PTU examinations had sent thousands of students in a tizzy.Though the university had reportedly decided to cancel all the nine papers after receiving a report from Bathinda police, the list of subjects whose papers have been cancelled was not available at the PTU centres till Saturday evening.The PTU authorities denied to divulge anything further in this regard asking students as well as mediapersons to contact the PTU centres. Investigation by TOI revealed that in a communique to the PTU last week, the Bathinda police had written to the university regarding the leakage of following papers: Developing Desktop & Database Application with V-B (MSc,IT-IInd semester), Website Development (MSc-IInd semester), Application Development (MSc-IIIrd semester), Enterprising Java Development (Msc IIIrd semester), Programming in Freesharp (MSc-IIIrd semester), C,C++(PGDCA-Ist semester), Soft Engineering RD BMS development with Oracle (PGDCA-Ist semester), Data Structure (PGDCA-IInd semester) and Developing Application and Applets with Java (PGDCS-IInd semester).The investigation into the paper leakage case, on the other hand, came to a virtual standstill on Saturday. While four accused, Baldeep Singh and Ravinder Singh of Bathinda, Sukhpal Singh of Chandigarh and Sanjiv Kumar of Sunam, who were arrested by the Bathinda police, were granted bail on Saturday, the court stayed the arrest of the alleged kingpins of the gang till April 19.Sources in the Bathinda police revealed that one Akshay Kumar, the incharge of a PTU centre at Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, allegedly supplied question papers to various cyber cafes in Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat for a hefty amount. Police were expecting to reach at the bottom of the racket after interrogating Akshay and his one accomplice but the arrest of both the accused was stayed after they reached the court of additional session judge, Bathinda.	0
HOSHIARPUR: Does it matter whether the BJP-SAD combine retains power or the Congress wrests it from them in the forthcoming Municipal Committee (MC) elections on Sunday? If one goes with the majority vote then people care less for who wins or loses. The obvious reason being the pathetic condition of the city.With the city almost bearing the look of one big garbage can strewn all over, citizens of Hoshiarpur are almost unanimous in their opinion that whosoever comes into power things will remain the same.''What difference will it make if the present lot of MC's is changed? My children will get the same unhygienic water, I'll be driving on the same pot-holed roads and there would be uncleared garbage lying in my neighbourhood,'' says Dr Juneja, a private practitioner.While the two main parties, the BJP-SAD combine and the Congress, remain locked in rhetoric in an attempt to establish political supremacy, the fact of the matter is that none of the parties are fighting elections on local issues. None of them have released a local manifesto. ''Who cares if an epidemic happens due to the filth in the city. The Dusherra ground resembles more of a garbage dump,'' says Vishal Saini, a businessman. There is not even a single park where one can go and take a walk in the evening, he adds.A round of the city actually establishes the fact that no political party has taken up the issue of upgrading living standards of the people. Safe drinking water, better sanitation and improved roads doe not not figure in any political parties' agenda.There is no place to park your car if you go to Ghanta Ghar or anywhere in the city, says Amit Goel, an engineer. Stray cattle roams around the Gaushala bazaar and rotten fruits and vegetables cover the road in certain parts, he adds. While the BJP-SAD combine and the Congress remain busy calculating combinations and permutations of how to muster votes in various wards, peoples issues seem to be the last thing on their mind.	1
"NEW DELHI: Unfazed by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) raging in China, Defence Minister George Fernandes is all set to embark on his week-long path-breaking visit to China from April 20. The visit of Fernandes, who has severely criticised China in the past, will set the agenda for the visit of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Beijing later in the year. Fernandes will also raise Indian concerns about the continuing Chinese help to Pakistan''s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, as also its mounting military presence in the Bay of Bengal. New Delhi is also keen to accelerate the delineation of the 4,057-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) to settle the complicated border dispute with China. ""During the visit, Fernandes will hold talks with his Chinese counterpart, General Cao Gangchuan, and other leaders. He will also visit military establishments around Beijing and Shanghai,"" said an official. This will be the first visit of an Indian defence minister to China since Sharad Pawar in 1992. Fernandes will be accompanied by defence secretary Subir Datta and other senior officials from the defence ministry and the three Services."	0
LUCKNOW: The government has detected ''fake widows'' and others availing themselves of pension schemes for the past several years and issued instructions for the recovery of money taken by them. As of now, as much as Rs 2.85 lakh is to be recovered from them.Of them, three women from Faizabad and 19 from Rae Bareli, were availing widow pensions for the past several years.Besides, officials have also identified thousands of people all over the state who were taking benefits from various welfare schemes started by the state. During preliminary investigation, it also came to light that many people were availing themselves benefit on the name of those dead, said an official of the state.It is interesting to note that the Mritak Sangh (the association to take up the cause of those alive but declared dead in the government records) has urged the President of India to look into the complains of the Sangh and has even threatened to sit on dharna. According to official information, this year 67,703 people were sanctioned old-age and kisan pensions and to another 119,704 people Rs 17.086 crore had been distributed. The officials concerned were told to complete this job by organising special camps in the state. For this purpose, 222 supervisors and 315 assistant development officers were put on the job, said an official of the government. Till now, the government had distributed as much as Rs 184.58 crore for the old-age and Kisan pension schemes, said the official.	0
NEW DELHI: Three ''aspiring models'' aged between 21 to 25 years were arrested from the ridge area on Sunday afternoon for prostitution, claim police. The alleged kingpin of the racket, Kiran alias Mummy (55), has also been arrested. Three men, who allegedly helped Kiran, were nabbed from the spot where the police had sent a decoy customer.Kiran reportedly lured these women into prostitution by promising them a chance to participate in high-profile fashion shows.''By the time they realised that they had been pushed into prostitution, it was too late,'' deputy commissioner of police (north) Sanjay Baniwal said.While one of the three women is from Delhi, the other two are from Mumbai and Meerut. ''One of them was on contract and was required to earn between Rs 30,000 to Rs 1 lakh. They had to entertain two customers daily,'' a police officer said. Kiran took a 50 per cent share from the daily earnings of the women.''The clients would contact Kiran on her cellphone to strike a deal. When the girls reached the designated destination, the clients would again call within 10 minutes to confirm the same. If no call was received, everybody went underground anticipating police action,'' the officer added.Kiran was involved in this trade for the past 15 years. The police claim that she had a wide network. ''She has been arrested four times under the Immoral Trafficking Act and the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act,'' the officer said.	0

"NEW DELHI: If protests by a number of Cabinet ministers on the budget allocations for 2003-04 are any indication, the chances are that social sectors may lose out in a big way.Ministers, including those of labour, environment, tourism and culture, have written to Planning Commission Deputy Chairman K C Pant, drawing attention to how ""frozen"" allocations dictated by gross budgetary support of Rs 117,500 crore would impact thrust areas.Labour Minister Sahib Singh, who also met Finance Minister Jaswant Singh on Thursday on this issue, told Pant that an outlay of Rs 170 crore, the same as last year, was ""too meagre to undertake the new proposed initiatives in the areas of skill development, occupational safety and health, awareness generation and labour statistics"".Requesting Pant for Rs 327 crore, Singh specifically mentioned the impact on the Krishi Shramik Suraksha Yojna, promised in last year''s budget. Even Prime Minister Vajpayee''s promise to set up ITIs in the North-East may be difficult to implement.Environment Minister Baalu, saddled with two of the 11 monitorable targets identified in the 10th Plan, is upset at the prospect of ""stagnant"" allocations. Forestry and environment were core areas of development strategy, said Baalu, and there were ambitious plans to increase forest cover and clean up major rivers by 2007.But right now, the ministry is slated to get just over Rs 1,000 crore, the same amount as last year. Critical projects already underway would suffer and new projects would not be taken up, warned Baalu. Last year, he said, the ministry used its Plan outlay fully, even getting Rs 100 crore more. This year, too, it has been seeking more money.The same goes for the tourism and culture ministry, where tourism was being touted as a major engine of growth and employment. Going by present projections, the tourism department would get a slight increase over budget estimates for 2002-03 - from Rs 225 crore to Rs 325 crore. Just not enough, however, to kickstart anything.Minister Jagmohan, raising this with Pant, said that their aim was to keep up the momentum, giving a thrust to conservation, repair and restoration of neglected monuments and fuelling tourism. If some special priority was not possible at this time, several monuments might go beyond the realm of possible conservation. For the first time, said Jagmohan, they would be spending, in fact exceeding, the entire allocated amount in the current year.At the moment, tourism is one of less than a dozen sectors slated to get more than earlier. On this list are the departments of power, road transport, science, railways, atomic energy, tribal affairs and women and child development. Unless budgetary support goes up, a slew of projects may see a slowdown.Among these, infrastructure schemes such as the National Highway Development Project, railway projects such as the metropolitan urban transport project in Mumbai and the Golden Quadrilateral route upgradation, hydel projects, programmes related to drinking water, rural sanitation, agriculture, education and river conservation, a textile sector package for Jammu and Kashmir, even the space programme."	1

"MUMBAI: Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) general secretary Praveen Togadia lashed out at secularism in India, terming it ''jehadi''.He was speaking at a felicitation function organised by several trade groups, including the Federation of Associations of Maharashtra and the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.Two books, Ayodhya Thi Godhra'' (From Ayodhya to Godhra) by Saurabh Shah and Chhathhi December Pacchi'' (After December 6) by Virendra Parekh, were also released by him.Mr Togadia is in the city to address a rally on Sunday to consolidate the Ram Janmabhoomi agitation.

""In the 52 Islamic countries have they ever had a non-Muslim head of state?"" he asked.""When people ask me what is the condition of minorities here, I counter, ''Would you ever ask what is the condition of minorities in England or Germany''?"" he said."	0
"NEW DELHI: In Madhya Pradesh''s last assembly elections, the spiralling price of onions was among the factors that helped Digvijay Singh re-capture the state. And the BJP is worried that this time, a cake a"" whose ingredients are still a mystery a"" and beef, both definitely not kosher for good Hindus, could make it weep again.The BJP may publicly taunt Digvijay for employing the soft Hindutva card.But privately, it is rattled. There is a feeling that the badly-divided BJP unit in MP may not be able to match Digvijay''s political wiles. His challenge to centrally legislate a ban on cow slaughter and his questioning of the appropriateness of Uma Bharti offering a birthday cake to Hanuman, BJP sources say, has derailed the BJP''s election campaign.""Digvijay has ruled MP for 10 years. The roads are terrible, there is a water and power crisis. ""We should be fuelling the anti-incumbency factor instead of getting sidetracked,"" a BJP functionary said.Party sources said BJP president Venkaiah Naidu has already told chief ministerial nominee Uma Bharti not to allow herself to get distracted by the cake ""kand"" (scandal) a"" as the regional newspapers are describing it.Instead, she should focus on Digvijay''s shortcomings in governance, Naidu has stressed. As for his challenge to the Centre to ban cow slaughter, a draft Bill is ready and awaiting the cabinet''s approval for being sent to the administrative ministry a"" agriculture. Sources said the issue is on the agenda for next week''s cabinet meeting so that the Bill can be introduced in Parliament in this session itself.The draft Bill differs from the laws in existence in the states in that it does away with permission to kill ""aged, sick, and dying cows"" as this clause has been misused. To circumvent the fact that only the states can legislate on this subject, the Centre, government sources said, proposes to use the clause that if two states ask the Centre to legislate on a state subject, it can do so. So the BJP-ruled states of Goa and Gujarat have already been lined up.At the same time, while the Bill is ready, the BJP is divided on its usefulness as an electoral issue. ""One section of the leadership feels that issues like trishuls and a ban on cow slaughter are not vote-spinners and might just end up helping our political rivals,"" a party functionary said.So worried is the BJP that sources say that a major reason for passing the new anti-defection Bill are the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and neighbouring Chhattisgarh.The fear is that if the Congress emerges as the single largest party without a majority in these two states, Digvijay and Ajit Jogi will be able to lure away BJP MLAs."	0
"HYDERABAD: The Satya Sai Water Supply Project, a lifeline for more than 750 villages in the drought-hit Anantapur district, faces a serious threat from Karanataka's Paragodu project over river Chitravathi.Eight years ago, people in these villages a"" most of them fluoride affected a"" used to trek kilometres to fetch water. The Satya Sai project, completed in November 21, 1995, came as a boon to close to 9 lakh people people in these villages.It was completed in a year and inaugurated by then prime minister P V Narasimha Rao.Now, with Karanataka constructing the Paragodu project, this source of water too looks all set to dry up. Of the 750 villages, 213 draw their drinking water from the Penna Ahobilam Balancing Reservoir and seven summer storage tanks, all part of the Satya Sai water supply scheme.The rest 537 depend on borewells and filtration wells sunk on the Chitravati bed, by the Satya Sai project authorities. All these sources will dry up once Paragodu is commissioned.Besides, the Paragodu project will affect agriculture in about 37,000 acres of Anantapur and Kadapa districts and ground water levels in several villages over a 100-km stretch in Anantapur will go down to dangerous levels.While 14,000 acres are watered by nine tanks that get water from the Chitravati, the Parnapalli reservoir in Kadapa district caters to 18,000 acres in Kadapa and 5,000 acres in Anantapur district. The only source of water for this reservoir is the Chitravati river.The Paragodu project, on completion, will completely block water to Anantapur and Kadapa districts. To protest against the Paragodu project, Telugu Desam Party MPs and legislators organised demonstrations and also tried to stage a sit-in at the project site recently."	1
"WASHINGTON: The US is most likely to launch an offensive against Iraq in March as the conditions favourable for waging a war would be available then, a media report said on Sunday.The US Air Force likes to begin its bombing campaign in moonless nights. In Iraq, for two weeks in early March, the moon will remain below the horizon until at least 4 am, a report published in the ''Time'' magazine said here.The report said there will be 250,000 American troops on Iraq''s doorstep or just down the block.The number is more than enough to fight any sort of war that the Pentagon may be thinking of waging, it said quoting military officials.Despite their insistence in public that they are capable of fighting in an Iraqi summer, US military officials want to avoid a war in the season, the magazine said. By April, daytime temperatures soar over 100 degree Fahreinheit hampering soldiers wearing heavy suits to protect them from chemical and biological weapons. Helicopters cannot fly as efficiently in hot, thin air. Heat also causes equipment breakdown, it said adding more water has to be shipped to the front for its troops. The month is also suitable to its diplomatic timetable, Time said. Hans Blix, the head UN weapons inspector, who returns from Baghdad this week, will report to the Security Council on February 14. On the good assumption that he will not give Saddam Hussein''s regime a ""clean bill of health"", Council members are beginning to consider a final resolution.""So it will probably be sometime during those moonless nights at the beginning of March that the diplomatic phase will finally end and the military one begin, it said."	1
"PATNA: A delegation of the Bihar unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) met Union minister for food and public distribution and consumer affairs Sharad Yadav here and apprised him of the ""anomalous situation"" created by the recent amendment in the Consumer Protection Act, which has raised to ""astronomical heights"" the compensation to be paid by doctors for professional negligence.Yadav asked the IMA delegation to give their representation to the Union secretary of consumer affairs.Later talking to mediapersons on Monday, IMA delegation members, including Dr S N Arya, Dr Dilip Sen, Dr Vijay Shankar Singh, Dr Manju Gita Mishra and Dr Basant Singh, said that the IMA office-bearers met the Union secretary of consumer affairs in Delhi on Monday afternoon and that the secretary agreed to discuss the matter with them later on.The doctors said under the amended provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, the limit of the compensation to be granted by the district consumer forum and the state commission for redressal of consumer grievances has been raised to Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1 crore respectively. This amounts to ""rangdari"" (extortion) as many patients would file false cases of medical negligence just to get a huge compensation, they maintained.In a memorandum to Yadav, they demanded constitution of medical boards at the state and national levels with their doctor-members being selected by the Medical Registration Council and IMA. The doctors said the medical boards' role would be to decide whether a complaint regarding criminal negligence on the part of a doctor is prima facie tenable or not. A consumer forum should admit such a complaint for hearing only when it is found to be prima facie tenable by the medical board concerned, they suggested.They said the compensation given for healthy people dying in air crash and train accident is much less than the upper limit of the compensation allowed in the cases of medical negligence under the amended provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, adding that even the free medical treatment given by doctors has been brought under the purview of the Act.The doctors said persons filing complaint cases in consumer courts against doctors should be liable to pay compensation to the doctors concerned if their pleas are rejected by the consumer courts."	0
SRINAGAR: Security forces have busted a gang of militants engaged in grenade-throwing by arresting seven militants and recovered huge quantity of arms and ammunition in two different operations here since Sunday night, an official spokesman said on Monday.Acting on a specific tipoff, security forces raided different hideouts of pro-pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen in downtwon Srinagar following the arrest of deputy district commander of the outfit Tanveer Ahmad Khan alias Umar from Khanyar locality, the spokesman said.Based on the information provided by Khan, security forces netted four other militants identified as Shakil Ahmad Khanday, Jehangir Salim Khan, Bilal Ahmad Kaling and Qaiser Farooq Gilkar, he said.The spokesman claimed that this group was responsible for a series of grenade attacks on security forces and innocent civilians in the city.Khan was following the instructions of Hizb''s district commander Ibrahim Dar alias Salim, who is wanted in connection with a number of pistol shootings and grenade attacks on security forces and civilians, he added.In another operation, security forces arrested the district commander of Al Jehad militant outfit Nazir Ahmad Bhat from his Nawakadal residence, the spokesman said.Bhat revealed presence of a huge arms dump in the house of Ghulam Ahmad which was dug up and seized, the spokesman said adding the house owner was also arrested.He said the recoveries included four AK rifles, two pistols, two grenade launchers, 20 rifle grenades, three hand grenades and other assorted ammunition.	1
KOLKATA: For three years he had been fooling hoteliers, restaurateurs, cyber cafe owners and even the police. He made a fortune by posing as a CBI officer or as an IPS officer with the state police, taking hefty bribes, staying in hotels for free and getting his lunch and dinners paid for.Luck finally ran out for 27-yearold Surya Bose Roy Chowdhury on Saturday night, when he was picked up from a central Kolkata hotel.He had gone there posing as the SDPO of Contai to collect his monthly aduesa. It was after his arrest that the stunned officers of the criminal investigation department discovered that Roy Chowdhury had indeed been a policeman once upon a time.The Kolkata Police sub-inspector was sacked in 1999 after being caught red-handed while cheating a Japanese couple pretending he was a DSP with the CBI. aHe was arrested by the Taltala police while undergoing training at the Barrackpore Police Training School. After serving his sentence, he had disappeared,a said special superintendent (CID) Manoj Malviya.Almost four years later, Roy Chowdhury was arrested from the central Kolkata hotel taking a hefty bribe.It was just four days ago that the police got the first tip-off when a resident of Regent Park lodged a complaint. aWhen we started investigating based on a sketch of the person described to us, we were shocked when owners of almost all hotels and cyber cafes we went to told us that he was known to them as a DSP. One cyber cafe owner even said he had come to him with an ID card claiming to be a senior CBI officer probing the Aftab Ansari case,a Malviya said.Finally, the detectives laid a trap for Roy Chowdhury and caught him as he walked in posing as a top cop. aHe was so confident when he gave his ID, that even our boys felt a bit shaky. It was only after they had called up Contai and Burdwan and verified that no one called Surya Bose Roy Chowdhury had ever been an officer there, that he knew his game was up,a the SSP said. Roy Chowdhury was produced in court and remanded in police custody till July 7.	0

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday claimed to have averted a major terrorist strike by busting a ""high-profile"" al-Qaeda gang in Karachi and arresting six people, including a Yemenese national wanted in connection with the October 2000 suicide bombing of American warship USS cole.The six arrested members of the gang included Waleed Mohammad bin Attash, the prime accused in suicide attack on USS cole in Yemen in which 17 people were killed, an interior ministry spokesman said. A huge cache of arms and ammunition was also recovered from the gang, he said.About 150 kgs of explosives -- detonators, capacitators, grenades, a truck load of sulphur -- which were accumulated for a terrorist attack, were seized from the gang, he said.The gang was planning a major terrorist attack in Pakistan before it was busted, the spokesman was quoted by the state television as saying.In another development, hackers attacked the government of Pakistan''s websites, Geo News channel reported.The hackers launched Distributed Denial of Service Attack'' on the government websites, it quoted Director of state-owned Comsats Internet services, Pervez Butt, as saying.In view of the attack, the government has decided to shift all its websites to the National Telecommunication Corporation, to spare them from attacks, he said.Butt said Pakistan has not yet identified the country from where the hackers have launched the attack on the government websites."	1
"ANAND: Fuming at smokers on World No Tobacco Day? Well, farmers in Gujarat couldn't care less. They will gather as usual at the local Gujarat Agriculture University's Bidi Tobacco Research Station (BTRS) to select the best seeds on their way to make the state the second-highest tobacco producer in the country after Andhra Pradesh. The stretch between Vadodara and Kheda, known as the Charotar region, is the tobacco heartland.And, it's throbbing with life with many farmers planning to shift back to tobacco after experimenting with banana cultivation in the last couple of years. BTRS scientists proudly take credit for Gujarat producing over a third of the country's total tobacco production since the '80s. ""Our research on seeds has led to a multifold increase in yield,"" says BTRS acting head and research scientist B N Patel. ""No state can match us in productivity. In fact, we sell nearly 100 per cent of all tobacco seeds in the state."" For the record, BTRS sells between 25,000 and 30,000 kg of seeds and about two crore seedlings to farmers every year. According to official figures, Gujarat has over one lakh hectares under tobacco cultivation. In 2000-2001, it fell to 8,78,000 hectares, but is expected to cross one lakh hectares as the price of tobacco has gone up in the last 12 months. In 2000-2001, the state produced 1,486 metric tonnes of tobacco, 38 per cent of India's total production and 80 per cent of tobacco meant for bidis. In terms of productivity, Gujarat produces 1,692 kg per hectare, the highest in the country. The national average is 1,394 kg. Research scientist L M Ghelani is hoping the productivity improves further. ""Ideally,we would like to see less land under tobacco cultivation giving more yield so that other crops can be taken on the free land,"" he says. But farmers seem less inclined to experiment with other crops. Virendrabhai Patel of Saijpur village near Borsad is one of the largest producers of edible tobacco in the state with 50 hectares under cultivation. ""I do have some hectares for banana cultivation but it's too tedious,"" he says. ""Bananas have a short shelf life and are destroyed by either pests or wild animals. Tobacco, on the other hand, matures with age. The older the better."" The ceiling price of tobacco hovering at Rs 800 this year, as compared to Rs 625 last year, is an added incentive. Ask Patel about No Tobacco Day and he sniggers, ""They seem to have a day for just about anything these days. Anything consumed in excess is bad and it's the same with tobacco."" Yunus Sopariwala, the largest tobacco exporter in the state, couldn't agree more. ""Even tomato ketchup in excess is bad for health,"" he says, sitting in his office in Borsad. ""Gutkha, I know is injurious to health, but tobacco has some beneficial uses as well. For instance, you can extract solanesol, a compound used in cardiac drugs, or even nicotine sulphate, used in pesticides across Europe."" Sopariwala's firm has been exporting 12,000 tonnes of tobacco to the US, Canada, the Middle East and Europe for the last five years. As Mahiji Patel, another tobacco farmer from Alarsa village, puts it, ""It is difficult to get used to bananas, once you take to the taste of tobacco."""	1
"SRINAGAR: The state deputy power minister Javed Mustafa Mir on Thursday filed FIR against Rashtriya Rifle soldiers for misbehaving with him. Mir was on a routine visit to his Chadoora constituency in central Kashmir when he learnt of a search operation being jointly conducted by Rashtriya Rifles and Border Security Force in the area.The minister got down from his bullet-proof car to meet the residents who had been rounded up in an open field for an identification parade.""I told the security forces to conduct searches without harassing locals,"" Mir said. Instead, he saw them pick up five boys from the group and abuse them. ""One of them was beaten,"" the minister said.""I could not tolerate this and I told the army officers not to harass the locals. However, the soldiers misbehaved with me without any provocation,"" Mir said.The minister later went to the Chadoora police and filed an FIR. Mir added: ""After my return here, I spoke to the chief secretary. I told him to take up the matter with senior security officers. The officer and soldiers who were involved in the incident should be shifted from the area.""Mir''s father, a former MLA, was gunned down by militants in 1990."	0
"BANGALORE: PSU oil major BPCL on Thursday said that it was looking at importing crude oil from West African countries to offset the shortage of over one million tonnes of supplies from the Bombay High this year.""We are exploring the possibility of West African crude and crude from Yemen will be used for the Kochi Refinery. BPCL, jointly with HPCL, is exploring importing on large crude containers, the low sulphur crude from Nigeria into the west coast,"" BPCL chairman and managing director S Behuria told reporters here.During 2002-03, the total requirement of crude was 16.5 million tonnes, of which about 7.5 million tonnes was catered to by Bombay High.The balance nine million tonnes was imported from West Asia, through both contract and spot buying, he said.BPCL, Behuria said, bought crude from Saudi Aramco, Kuwait Petroleum Company, Abu Dhabi National Petroleum Company and Petronex. Last year, five million tonnes was sourced from the international market through spot buying.He said that the oil major in the current year was expecting 6.5 million tonnes from Bombay High, around five million tonnes from West Asia, and the rest through spot buying.Behuria said that all the oil majors in the country were together devising a strategy for buying crude from Iraq, but that might not happen in the current fiscal."	1
SRINAGAR: One person was killed and 15 others, including two policemen, injured when militants exploded a grenade at a crowded place in Anantnag district of south Kashmir on Tuesday, official sources said.Militants hurled a grenade towards policemen patrolling Mattan Chowk, 62 kms from here, around 5.30 pm causing splinter injuries to 14 pedestrians and two cops, the sources said.They said the injured were immediately removed to hospital where a civilian identified as Ghulam Mohiuddin was declared brought dead.The Condition of five injured persons was stated to be serious, the sources said.They said police assisted by security forces sealed the entire area soon after the explosion and a hunt has been launched to nab the militants.No militant outfit has claimed responsibility for the blast so far.	1
"KOLKATA: Two arch-rivals in West Bengal politics on Tuesday tried to woo the Centre, and predictably for diametrically opposite reasons. While Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee wanted to be in the good books of the Centre to ensure the downfall of the Left Front government, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said he wanted a ""working relationship"" with the Centre as both the LF and the NDA were running governments according to the Constitution.""We will abide by whatever Atal Behari Vajpayee says, because we want the CPM out from West Bengal,"" Banerjee said, reacting to the Prime Minister's statement that she was likely to be inducted into the Union Cabinet. This, observers felt, indicated that the Trinamul was not in a mood to bargain for the portfolio to be offered. Strategically, it would help the party to be a part of the government at the Centre in its fight with the CPM. The decision to take her back ""shows that the Prime Minister is finally thinking of Bengal."" Addressing a meet-thepress programme on the completion of two years of his government, Bhattacharjee, however, did not appear worried that Banerjee was returning to the Union Cabinet. ""I will be happy if she becomes a minister,"" he said. ""I hope she will work for the state now."" He made it clear that he had so far enjoyed an encouraging response from the Centre, particularly deputy prime minister L K Advani. ""We have got a good response on several issues, particularly civil aviation."" During his last visit to Delhi, he had his first meeting with Union finance minister Yashwant Singh as well and discussed threadbare the state government's financial problems. Bhattacharjee admitted he did not want confrontation with the Centre, rather he wanted a working relationship, ""as both of us are running governments according to the constitutional provisions"". The LF government did have, however, fundamental differences with the BJP-led Central government, particularly on foreign and economic policies. Among the issues on which the state government had not received adequate help from the Centre was the fund-sharing formula for small savings, he said. Also, the Centre had diluted the mandatory jute packaging order and had closed down big public sector units in the state."	1
"NEW DELHI: The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) does not even know how many properties exist in the illegal Sanik Farm area. Neither did it ever issue notices to owners of the unauthorised buildings, thus giving them a chance to go on constructing illegally.The civic agency's slackness in collecting data on the colony has, in a way, encouraged the illegal constructions.""Unless the exact number of properties in a colony is known through a survey, the MCD will never be able to identify new illegal buildings which may come up later on,"" said a building department official.Sainik Farm has grown in the last decade despite court restrictions on illegal construction. Very few demolitions were carried out in the colony and did not deter builders from doing additional construction.Also, the cash-starved civic agency has been unable to bear the cost of the demolitions that cost about Rs 5,000 an hour due to deployment of heavy machines.Illegal constructions in Sainik Farm, allege colony residents, have taken place in connivance with MCD and local police officials. ""The police set up barricades at the main entrances to the colony on Mehrauli-Badarpur Road to prevent entry of building material. But no attention has been paid to plug the illegal entry points at the rear of the colony,"" said a Sanik Farm resident.""But it's impossible that several buildings were built without the different agencies' field staff noticing the,"" he added."	0
"ANANTAPUR/BANGALORE: The Karnataka police on Friday arrested two Telugu Desam MPs and five MLAs, among others, when they tried to march to the Paragodu project after crossing the inter-state border.With the TDP legislators and MPs insisting on going towards Paragodu, about 10 km from the border, the Kolar district police took 23 leaders into custody and lodged them in the Bagepalli police station.The leaders were let off in the evening after they signed personal bonds.The TDP has called for an Anantapur district bandh on Saturday to protest the arrests. High drama preceded the arrest of the leaders at the border checkpost in the morning when TDP workers, led by Penugonda MLA Paritala Ravi and Anantapur MP K Srinivasulu insisted that the Anantapur police permit them to cross the border. Ministers Nimmala Kistappa and S Chandramohan Reddy addressed a public meeting at Kodikonda border point inside AP, but did not cross the border.Ravi and Srinivasulu urged the cadre to cross the border. Though Anantapur DIG A V Narayana and SP Anil Kumar initially refused to permit the TDP leaders to move further, they too later relented and allowed a small contingent to go ahead. However, before the TDP workers a"" about 500 of them a"" stepped into the Karnataka territory, they were stopped by the Kolar district police and asked to go back.When the TDP leaders refused to budge, they were huddled into waiting police vehicles and taken to Bagepalli town. The arrested include MP B K Parthasarathy, Srinivasulu, MLAs Ravi, K Jayaram, P Raghunath Reddy, Sainath Goud and C C Venkataramudu. Mild tension prevailed for a while, when Karnataka police bashed up a security guard to Ravi, who tried to get into the vehicle along with his boss.In Bangalore, two Karnataka ministers took a dig at the Centre for remaining silent over the aunnecessary ruckus'' by AP on the Chitravati barrage. Water resources minister H K Patil and Kolar district in-charge minister V Muniyappa asserted that Karnataka will complete the project as scheduled. aIt is our duty to provide drinking water to people. The Centre should take an interest in this and not keep quiet,'' Patil told reporters here.Muniyappa said: aThe dharna by AP will not change our minds. We will convince the Centre to support us on humanitarian grounds as most people in this area suffer from fluorosis.'' Patil said aWe are well within legal limits. Chitravati barrage proposal was laid before the Central Water Commission meeting at Hyderabad in December 2001. AP did not make any dissent note then,'' he pointed out, adding it was time AP leaders stopped making airresponsible statements''."	1

LUCKNOW: For the 70 plus labourer Chandra Bhal and his wife Maheshwari of Sitapur district, law and police caste images of barbarism and havoc. Having lost their innocent son Hori Lal to police bullets in what was said to be an encounter, for them life had come to an end. But the agony has not. The fault of the old couple is that they had pursued police investigations into the 'death of notorious criminal Hori Lal in police encounter' despite the fact that the youth did not have even a single criminal case against him anywhere in India.Fresh investigations into the case had accused the police team and Lallan Singh, a local goon who is alleged to have orchestrated the encounter. This has once again left the parents of Hori Lal at the mercy of fate. The accused policemen and Lallan Singh are allegedly on the prowl to kidnap the old couple to eliminate evidence against them. In the latest sequence, the accused swooped down at the Sarkara village hutments where Hori Lal's parents live. Allegedly an attempt was made by the prime accused Lallan Singh and the policemen accused of the fake encounter to kidnap the old couple. aThey want to eliminate anyone and everyone who is pursuing the law of the land,a said A Khote, the vice-president of Peoples Union For Human Rights, a social unit which had helped the parents of Hori Lal in their fight for justice. According to the sequence of events, Hori Lal was picked up by the police on July 4, 2002 from his house in Sakrara village under Machrehta police station of Sitapur district. He was shot dead by the police in Khairabad the same day. The encounter was found to be a fake one and a criminal case was registered against nearly a dozen people including police officers and Lallan Singh where they were charged with murder and criminal conspiracy. Pursued by the PUFUR, three of the accused policemen were arrested as well. Thereafter, the case went into cold storage and no more arrests could be made. On the contrary, so called aabsconding accuseda Lallan Singh and the policemen who could not be arrested so far, recently surfaced at the house of Hori Lal and assaulted his old parents threatening them to keep mum over the issue. They also threatened another half a dozen witnesses who gave their statements before the police to testify the kidnapping of Hori Lal by the police before he was shot dead. Terror stricken victims met the DIG Lucknow range AKD Dwivedi on Wednesday seeking his intervention. The DIG has assured prompt action and even directed immediate arrest of those who murdered Hori Lal. aAb bade sahab ka hi sahara haia (Now it is only the DIG from whom we have some hope) said Hori's father Chandra Bhal with folded hands. The fear was evident in his eyes and wrinkled face bore testimony to his agony.	0
PATNA: The legislative council on Thursday passed the Appropriation Bill, 2003 by voice vote.The Bill was okayed in the assembly on Wednesday itself.

NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commission on Monday took suo-motu cognisance of acquittal of all the 21 accused in the Best Bakery Case, during last year''s communal violence in Gujarat. The commission asked the state government to inform it of the steps it proposes to take against the court order. It has also asked for a copy of the order.``The chief secretary shall inform the commission what steps, if any, the Gujarat government is proposing to take against the order of acquittal,'''' the full commission said after a meeting.According to a commission official, ``What has come as a surprise is the lack of evidence. When the commission visited Gujarat and met witnesses and victims of Best Bakery case it was seen by us as a watertight case. Though witnesses did turn hostile, acquittal of all accused would have its repercussion on other violence cases.''''	1
PATIALA: Punjab State Electricity Board''s new chairman YS Ratra, while addressing the heads of various organisations of the PSEB during his first visit to the PSEB headquarters at Patiala, cautioned the senior officers that time and again an increase in tariff is not the real solution to pull the board out of the red.Instead the board officials at all levels should make every possible effort to increase the internal efficiency of the board.He stressed upon the need to improve the work culture and to increase the revenue of the board by reducing commercial losses and curbing the menace of theft of energy.Ratra also laid the emphasis on the improvement of consumer service by providing them prompt service and better quality of regular power supply at affordable prices.The chairman assured the officers of adequate support of the board towards curbing the menace of theft of power and smooth functioning of the PSEB.Earlier, SK Anand, member operation, welcomed the new chairman and gave his valuable suggestions to increase the internal efficiency and to improve the work culture in the PSEB. KS Kang, administrative member, HS Sohi, IRS member (F&A), HS Sahai, member (generation), Jaspreet Talwar, IAS secretary/ board were also present.Meanwhile, realising the difficulty and inconvenience caused to the consumers due to standing in long queues for the payment of energy bills at the PSEB cash counters, the Punjab State Electricity Board has decided to launch a unique consumer-friendly incentive based prepaid scheme from May 16, 2003 applicable to domestic, commercial, small power and agricultural power consumers who opt for it.A PSEB spokesman disclosed here on Friday that the option might be exercised any time during a billing cycle by making advance deposit.

NEW DELHI: Bihar government on Monday sought to defend itself in the Supreme Court on the issue of non-payment of salaries to thousands of employees working with various undertakings of the state government.  During hearing of the issue before a bench comprising Chief Justice of India V N Khare, Justice S B Sinha and Justice A R Lakshmanan, Bihar government counsel Shanti Bhushan refused to take the responsibility for the mess saying the undertakings were sick and winding up petitions had already been filed in the Patna High Court.  aLet the high court decide those winding up petitions. In any joint stock company, we are liable only to the extend we hold the shares,a Bhushan told the bench.  The PIL, filed by one Kapila Hingorani alleged that over 1,000 employees have died due to non-payment of salaries and the state government was not doing the needful. It also sought action against the officials responsible for the mess. When Hingorani requested the court to issue directions to the state government, the bench sought to know if the state government undertakings could be treated as 'state' within the meaning of Article 12.  The court gave two-week time to the petitioner to find out if there were any precedents of a writ of mandamus having been issued in a similar case and adjourned the hearing. Earlier, the court had on September 23 last issued notice to Bihar government on the petition that cited news reports highlighting the plight of employees due to non-payment of salaries.	0

"HYDERABAD: If there would ever be a an aircraft on fire on the ground, it is estimated that fire service personnel would have just 138 seconds to rescue trapped passengers. However, it takes a mere 120 seconds for the fire service staff of the Airports Authority of India to put out the blaze in any part of the airport.""No passenger can survive a blaze in a plane for more than 138 seconds.That is why our response time for putting out the fire is 120 seconds. And this we practice regularly,"" S Shankar Gopal, AAI senior manager (fire), told The Times of India on Monday.He was speaking after a demonstration of a rescue of a man caught in an oil fire by his staff at the airport at Begumpet on Monday on the occasion of Fire Services Day.""Rescue of passengers is our primary goal. Our exercises, be it putting out fires using foam once a month, daily drills by our staff or equipping them with the best of equipment, it is all geared up for this task,"" he explained.The demonstrations were observed by the airport director K Ramakrishna, additional general manager (ATC) RP Singh among others.The AAI fire service wing is equipped with four tenders and three ambulances with powerful engines that enable speedy acceleration. In addition to several other pieces of equipment that help the fire fighters cut through metal clutter in the event of a fire, the team also has proximity suits, made of special fabrics that are heat resistant and allow them to walk through fires when rescuing trapped passengers.The airport fire services wing has a strength of 77 who work in three-hour shifts of 25 each. ""Every time a plane lands or takes off, a fire tender is close to the runway, which helps in faster than the 120 seconds response time,"" Gopal said. Explaining how they tackle an aircraft on fire, he said the target is the fuselage of the plane where the fuel is stored."	1
"HYDERABAD: The river Godavari can meet the ever-increasing drinking water needs of the twin cities, according to BJP state vice-president S V Seshagiri Rao.Though the party supports the government's efforts to bring Krishna water to the city, the quantum of water would not be sufficient in the near future, he said.The government should make an effort to bring Godavari water to the twin cities to tide over the perennial water crisis, he observed.Rao has done extensive work on the Godavari-Krishna drainage pattern and is known as an authority on the subject.As the crisis worsens by the year and as drinking water resources shrink, the risk of conflict over the issue will become greater in a few years if the government fails to take right steps on the issue. Hence, the government should utilise the Godavari water, Seshagiri Rao said.According to the Bachawat Award (1980), the state was given a share of 1,480 tmc ft out of 3,000 tmc ft (at 75 per cent dependability) of the river Godavari water (including the releases from Bhoopalapatnam hydro power project), out of which 670 tmc ft of water would be left unutilised even after all the ongoing schemes are completed.A number of projects meant for chronic drought-prone areasa"" Telugu Ganga, Galeru-Nagari, Handri-Neeva, Velugonda, Srisailam Left Bank Canal, Nettempadu, Kalwakurthi and Bhima a"" are totally dependent on surplus waters of Krishna (outside the quota allowed Bachawat).However, he doubts that surplus quantity of Krishna would be available for the state.Seshagiri Rao said four lowlevel dams on Godavari should be built with zero submergence at Ellampalli, Ichampalli, Dummagudem and Polavaram. Water could be lifted by heavy pumping systems and the upland reservoirs be filled during the four monsoon months, he said.The benefits would be enormous as about 50 lakh acres would come under irrigation afresh a"" 35 lakh acres in the Telangana region, seven lakh acres in coastal Andhra and eight lakh acres in the Rayalaseema area besides it would pave way for the supply of drinking water to the twin cities, the BJP leaders added."	1
"PUNE: The Reserve Bank of India Governor Bimal Jalan on Monday said that the apex bank will continue with its soft monetary policy stance and that the inflation outlook in the country is good.""Inflation outlook is good, very benign and despite the high oil prices and drought it is at a historical low of around 3.5 per cent, which is very unusual"", Jalan said on the sidelines of the National Institute of Bank Management''s annual day function.Asked about the interest rate outlook given the tame inflation and huge foreign exchange inflows, he said it was expected to be benign. Referring to the repo rate, Jalan said as and when necessary it would be changed but there is no proposal to cut the rate as of now and the yields are for the market to decide. On the bank rate, which is the lowest since 1973, he said no change is planned till the end of the current fiscal. On surplus liquidity in the market due to foreign inflows, the RBI Governor said management of this excess inflow posed a problem. The foreign exchange reserves as in the last week of December had crossed US dollar 70 billion.""Any repayment of external debt is for the government to decide and I think they have already repaid some amount"", he added."	1
MUMBAI: Sunanda Shetty (52), the mother of actress Shilpa Shetty, and her secretary, Bhupinder Singh Sachdev, were granted provisional anticipatory bail by the sessions court on Thursday in an extortion case. Judge H.S. Deshpande granted each of them bail of Rs 40,000 in cash and directed Ms Shetty to apply for regular anticipatory bail on or before June 12 at the trial court in Surat, where the case has been registered.Mr Sachdev appeared in person, but Ms Shetty is currently in a hospital in Dubai. When her absence was pointed out by public prosecutor R.V. Kini, the judge said that the regular trial court in Surat would look into it. Mr Kini contended that the court should hear the application only when Ms Shetty is present in court. In an anticipatory bail application, the applicant has to be present unless the court exempts the appearance. Ms Shetty's lawyer had not sought such an exemption nor did she sign the bail application, Mr Kini pointed out. It was Mr Sachdev who had signed the joint bail application, Mr Kini said. Mr Sachdev was not named in the FIR filed against the Shettys in Surat. H.H. Nagi, the advocate for Sunanda Shetty, said there was apprehension that the police might arrest Mr Sachdev in the case and hence a common bail application was moved. The judge, after hearing both sides, said that the Surat trial court would look into this aspect. He observed that since Mr Shetty was granted provisional bail on May 17, Sunnanda Shetty was also entitled to bail on grounds of parity.	0

Many more cases relating to such crimes go unreported as many victims hesitate to lodge complaints, police officials said. However, 85 per cent of cases where complaints are registered, meet a dead end.The reasons for this are many, say officials. The police investigations take a long time while legal battles takes much longer period. The victims do not wait for so long and reach a compromise with the accused. There is also the incidence of witnesses turning hostile weakening the case, officials said. The government has set up a Women's Protection Cell (WPC), to look in to those cases where local police fail to do justice. aThe WPC takes up investigation of only serious cases. Others are directed to the local police,'' superintendent of police heading the cell, K Narasimha Reddy, told The Times of India.	1

PUNE: Student organisations, who are a party to the ongoing admission tussle with the management of private engineering and medical colleges in the Bombay high court, said on the eve of the hearing that they will be filing review petitions in the apex court in the advent of a verdict not going in their favour. The matter dates back to October 31 last year when the supreme court passed a verdict, saying that admissions to private unaided colleges could not be governed by the state.Private unaided institutions were also given the liberty to decide their own fee structure by the court. The Bombay high court,which on July 4 stayed the first-year admissions process across the state until it decides on a clutch of 11 petitions on the issue, will start hearing the petitions from Tuesday. While the Students' Federation of India (SFI) has decided to table a detailed report prepared by constitutional expert Sathyaranjan Sathe, who has said that private educational institutions have atwisteda the October 11 supreme court order for their own vested interests, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad's (ABVP) public interest litigation has already urged the court to direct all private unaided colleges to follow the centralised admissions procedure as well as get their fees approved by the state-appointed regulatory authority. aWe are hoping for a favourable verdict from the high court, but if that does not happen, we'll have no alternative but to file a review petition in the supreme court,a ABVP secretary Dhananjay Kulkarni told TNN. aThe process in this regard has already begun.a On the other hand, SFI secretary Maharudra Dake, who had earlier appealed to both the state as well as the central governments to file review petitions in the apex court, said even the federation is contemplating a similar step if the high court fails to deliver a verdict supporting its cause.

Special counsel Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, when contacted, told TNN, aThe future course of action is dependent on the ruling by the high court.a Kumbhakoni had earlier said a decision on moving the apex court would be taken after the Bombay high court hearing.	1

"KOLKATA: Confusion reigned supreme in the Trinamul Congress camp over an honourable way out of the party's assembly boycott, a day after deputy Prime Minister LK Advani brushed away Mamata's Banerjee's ardent appeal to impose President's rule in West Bengal.Trinamul insiders said, Mamata had hoped to extract some form of assurance from Advani that the Centre would take measures to stop CPM from rigging elections a"" the issue on which Trinamul was continuing the boycott for over a month now.Failure to elicit this assurance left her with no explanation for withdrawing the boycott.With pressure mounting among her party MLAs, who want to withdraw the boycott immediately, Mamata had earlier urged Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim to open a dialogue, so that she could ask her MLAs to return to the assembly.Halim had turned a deaf ear to the appeal. With the number of rebel MLAs increasing by the day and with the Congress tacitly extending a helping hand to them, Mamata loyalists in the Trinamul said they were frantically searching a way out of the crisis. The deadline is July 15. The next day, the post of the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, now held by Subrata Mukherjee, along with several others, would go up for grabs with the chance of Congress getting them becoming a distinct possibility.In a desperate attempt at damage control, Mamata, however, is trying to convince her party bosses that Advani's visit to her party office, after all, has a silver lining. He has at least admitted that level playing field for parties does not exist here. aAs deputy PM, he cannot openly say that the Centre is contemplating intervention. Instead of being dejected, we should rather be delighted and continue demanding imposition of President's rule here,a she argued.Significantly, Advani's visit not only affected the Trinamul's morale but also intensified the ongoing rivalry in the state BJP. According to sources, union minister Tapan Sikdar has demanded removal of Tathagata Ray from the post of state BJP president.After ensuring an impressive turn out at Netaji Indoor Stadium during Shyama Prasad Mookerji's birth anniversary celebrations on Sunday, Sikdar reportedly reminded Advani that Ray's recent rally at Shahid Minar was a complete flop in spite of the presence of Shatrughan Sinha and Mamata."	1
"LUCKNOW: In a bid to give a fair deal to the fair sex, the IT sector in UP has decided to go women friendly. Little things which brighten the life of a woman, specially in rural areas, forms the basic theme for the Decision Support System Project (DSSP) launched by the department. The pilot project, successfully completed in Jhansi, has elicited favourable response and now the next phase of the scheme targets the KAVAL towns, led by the capital city, IT minister Sheema Rizvi said on Tuesday.The objective, according to Rizvi, is to develop software a"" a comprehensive database a"" on issues which have a direct bearing on women's day-to-day life. The project in Jhansi, which was completed in July last, primarily focused on five areas, namely health, education, drinking water, irrigation and roads she added. aOur team went down to collect the minutest details, to the actual number of hand-pumps in working condition, and how many more are required besides pinpointing exact spots where drilling should be done depending upon the availability of underground water,a claimed the minister.Jhansi and the entire Bundelkhand area is dry and faces an acute water scarcity round the year. aInformation provided in the software has already helped the authorities in formulating various welfare scheme,a she pointed out.The format in Lucknow is likely to be more broad-based. aWe are nearing completion of a survey of numbers and condition of schools, particularly girls schools, within the city and peripheral areas,a Rizvi said. The mandate, she added, was to include detailed information on the state of the buildings, number of classrooms and, most importantly, whether they offer toilet facilities to girls. This, incidentally, is the most neglected aspect which eventually leads to absenteeism among girl students, she pointed out.Similarly, the software will also catalogue the health infrastructure, down to the number of women doctors posted at community health centres and their availability. Besides, details of PHCs and their distance from villages will also find a clear mention in it.The software, said IT secretary GB Patnaik, also gave an insight into the actual women's empowerment in UP by recording the number and the background of women representatives at the Panchayat level, right from the member to the Pradhan apart from the district level functionaries.The software for Lucknow would be completed shortly, he said and added that once the KAVAL towns are covered the department planned to cover each district in UP. aHowever, this will be a lengthy process and would take longer,a the minister pointed out."	1
Harmonious coexistence is a leitmotif in the Indian way of life. One patch of Indian land embraces all universal faiths. And this spirit of brotherhood springs from the eternal truth that the vast reservoir of spiritual strength, knowledge and wisdom that is India will always overflow as long as more and more people drink from it and spread its message of Ahimsa and a holistic lifestyle, says Mrs Indu Jain, Chairman Timesgroup.After all, is it a mere coincidence that, strain- ing against an increasingly unruly existence, people the world over are looking to India to help them get in touch with their inner being? That the most rich and famous seek the anonymity of some remote corner to recuperate and absorb the tranquillity that touches every part of this ancient land?India, building on its heritage of nonviolence, stands out as a nation that will never initiate war.Pushed to the limits, it is still in search of a peaceful resolution of disputes with its neighbours. Internationally, its opposition to unilateralism is unconditional and well known. India can and does contribute this treasure of peace to the world and is a natural choice as peacekeeper in nations that need a healing touch.Nonviolence is not a conscious practice, it is an innate essential, a fundamental value that stems from a tradition of love and oneness only enhanced by diversity. Diversity is beautiful. If we can see unity in this diversity this is the true Sat Cid Ananda we all seek.The Ahimsa Movement of Media Moves is an effort to gather the more empowered sections of society on one platform to spread the message of nonviolence. The initiative, already underway, now needs the impetus of mass support. A universal faith is reposed in a fair media, for it has the power to facilitate change.At a function on Thursday, communities, corporates and other organisations will share their action plans. But it is not all about mere talking, those already planting the seed of nonviolence in each heart are the real ambassadors of this movement, and their participation will provide leadership.Drawing on traditional endurance and tolerance, the speakers will focus on how to spread the message of Ahimsa through a corps of not only peacekeepers, but also peacemakers. All of us, who believe that tomorrow has to be rid of the ravages of war, must be part of that global team.If armies can be trained in war tactics, there is an exigent need for a bigger army to be trained in the tactics of nonviolence. To get ready a powerful positive force to counter the negativism of hatred and violence. At stake is freedom. Both spiritual and physical. That freedom shall be a reality only when there is freedom for all.Let us all like-minded people get together in this unique initiative at 4 Tilak Marg, 6 pm on Thursday May 8, 2003.	1
NEW DELHI: The School of Correspondence Courses in Delhi University has witnessed much discord in the past month. Teachers have been protesting against the delay in the formation of the Campus of Open Learning (COL) and the appointment of an officer on special duty (OSD) as the school head after the acting principal resigned earlier this month.The teachers say the appointment of the OSD is unnecessary as a director for the COL has already been appointed by the varsity.''The school had an acting principal, R K Anand, for eight years,'' said J Khuntia, School of Correspondence staff council secretary and economics teacher.''The university did not appoint a full-time principal as COL was on the cards. Now that Anand has resigned after eight years following protest by teachers, S K Vij, a professor from south campus has been appointed the head of the institute,'' he said. The protesting teachers say this will only serve to create confusion in the functioning of the school. ''There is a chairperson-cum-director and an OSD. No one knows what the other is doing,'' he added. Anita Dighe was appointed the director of COL last year.The President of India approved the conversion of the School of Correspondence Courses to COL in 1999. Four years later, the conversion is yet to come through. ''After the acting principal's resignation, the director should have been handed over his responsibility,'' he said.But Dighe herself refuted the theory. ''Since the school is there, there has to be a principal. And since I am the director COL and the chairperson of the school managing committee I cannot act as the principal as well,'' said Dighe.She, could not say if the school would still be in existence once the COL comes through. Khuntia said the director was appointed only after a report by the dean of sciences K C Tripathi, who was the school OSD between 2001 and 2002. University proctor Shyam Menon, however, said Dighe was appointed the chairperson to allow her to act effectively as the director COL. ''There were serious allegations against R K Anand. He stepped down to facilitate the inquiry,'' said Menon.He said the OSD has been appointed to tide over the period preceding the conversion. ''Everybody was expecting an overnight transition. Teachers assumed the school will become a university department,'' he said.But there is a statute 19 that prevents that. University teachers have to have certain academic qualifications, he added.	1

"JAMMU: Nearly a month after the massacre of 24 Kashmiri Pandits, Nadimarg bears a deserted look as eleven survivors along with 21 other Pandits arrived here bidding adieu to the Kashmir Valley.""Eleven members of minority Pandit community who had survived the brutal carnage of Pandits at Nadimarg have arrived here along with 21 other pandits from Valley,"" Vice-President, All State Kashmiri Pandits Conference (ASKPC), Hira Lala Chatta said on Wednesday.Besides Nadimarg village, seven people of two families from village Begam in Kulgam area of Anantnag and two other Pandits from Srinagar also arrived here, he said.With this migration, a total of 154 Pandits have migrated from Valley to Jammu after Nadimarg massacre, Chatta said.""No Pandits is now staying in Nadimarg as all have migrated the village and we arrived in the last batch,"" a carnage survivor, Chuni Lal said.Soon after carnage, six people migrated from village followed by migration of 24 Pandits on April 6 and last batch of 11 arrived on Tuesday night here.""Administration did not allow us to move out the village, where huge policemen were kept for our guard duty,"" Lal alleged.""We are not safe anymore in valley not because of our Muslim brethren, but due to massive movement of foreign mercenaries, who rule the roost in Valley,"" Lal said."	0
"KOLKATA: CPM and SUCI cadres are threatening to boycott the forthcoming panchayat elections in Kadipukur village in Chaitanyapur gram panchayat in South 24-Parganas, alleging 'non-performance' by the local panchayat, whch is controlled by the Trinamul Congress.According to SUCI and CPM supporters, there has been little progress here in the last five years.They claim the area has remained under-developed compared to neighbouring panchayats like Saradona, Chandpur, Udaypur and Dhannoghata, specially in respect to roads, street lighting and health care.All these panchayats are under the control of the Left Front. aWe have informed the Block Development Officer about lack of amenities in the area, but no notice has been taken. That is why we are boycotting the elections,a said SUCI member Tapan Naskar.This stand was seconded by CPM's Bablu Haldar who said, ""Even basic amenities that a gram panchayat is expected to provide are missing in this area.""The population of Kadipur is about 2,500 of which 2,100 are registered voters. Supporters and cadres of both parties have already started wall-writing, urging villagers not vote and 'punish' the Trinamul Congress administration for not keeping promises.Trinamul Congress members, however, retaliated saying such a campaign unjustified and an attempt to malign the party. ""If there are lapses, we are willing to look into them should we come to power again,"" said Chaitanyapur gram panchayat upapradhan Ashok Panda."	0
"NEW DELHI: The Left seems to have held the Congress responsible for the inadequate scale of the anti-war campaign in India in comparison with the protest movements elsewhere.Despite the fact that at the all-party meeting, Congress president Sonia Gandhi took a clear stand against war, the party''s subsequent ''cautious'' approach to building a movement has disappointed the Left.""We expected a much stronger Congress response to the situation,"" CPI general secretary AB Bardhan said on Thursday. He felt that being the principal opposition party, the Congress had a responsibility to reflect the people''s mood about the ongoing war.He, in fact, hinted at the opportunity provided by the anti-war protests to the Congress to regain the support of some social segments, particularly the Muslims.He, however, affirmed that the Left parties would go ahead with their agitation plan on the issue.Asked if the Congress hesitation was responsible for the low level of protests, CPM general secretary H K S Surjeet remarked: ""It is true that compared to some other countries, the anti-war campaign has so far been inadequate."" He, however, avoided directly blaming the Congress.The Left has decided to step up its campaign with rallies and demonstrations over the next few days."	1
KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: Almost parroting Union home minister L.K. Advani's observations, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Saturday alleged that terrorist organisations were operating in Bangladesh and were attempting to destabilise India through criminal activities.Addressing the annual combined parade of West Bengal and Kolkata police, Bhattacharjee asked the security forces to be more vigilant and active to combat the designs of the terrorists.aThe state police force has to be more harsh while dealing with these disruptive forces,a he said. aA number of fundamentalist and terrorist organisations are operating from our neighbouring country and our police force will have to be more vigilant and active to disrupt their evil designs,a Bhattacharjee said. aWe want friendly relations with our neighbouring countries.But the activities of these organisations are in the direction of destabilising the country,a he added. Meanwhile, India and Bangladesh have agreed to avoid using force in dealing with illegal immigration, visiting Bangladesh foreign minister Morshed Khan said on Saturday, the concluding day of his visit. Khan called on the Prime Minister and deputy prime minister before leaving. He played down the issue of any agreement on illegal immigration, saying there acould be illegal migration on both sidesa. The only agreement reached was to discuss issues and remain engaged. Bangladesh had no record about any illegal immigration to India.Though the interaction with the media saw journalists raise almost every contentious issue, Khan chose to respond in general terms, stressing on Bangladesh's desire to develop bilateral relations. On the charges of Al-Qaida links, Khan said the government would soon take the diplomatic community to those areas so that they could ascertain the facts for themselves. Khan said criminal elements from Bangladesh were also sheltering in India and he had handed over a list of more than 200 names during his talks with external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha on Friday.On selling gas to India, Khan said a decision on this would be made on commercial rather than political considerations. About the defence agreement Bangladesh had recently signed with China, Khan said such agreements were not intended against a third country. On terrorism Khan said both terrorism and poverty had to be addressed as poverty was the root of terrorism.	0
LUDHIANA: As yet another International Women's Day is being celebrated, talks about women power will flow in abundance. But, the day is also an apt time to note that women constitute a mere 3.4 per cent of the total 144 IPS officers in Punjab. Punjab police services (PPS) has no different scenario to offer. Country's first IPS officer, Kiran Bedi joined the force in 1973, but it was after twenty long years before Punjab saw another woman officer, when IPS cadre Gurpreet Deo, joined the Punjab cadre in 1993.Currently SSP, Hoshiarpur, Deo has also served as SSP, Ludhiana for few months. The lack of women officials and late recruitment is also attributed to the terrorism spell in the state. Ludhiana's police force of 4,200 has no more than 60 odd policewomen, which is nearly 1.5 percent of total.Ludhiana SSP Harpreet Singh Sidhu pointed that a healthy force should have 26 percent of women employees to carry out various duties, which women can always do better. These include arresting accused women, investigating a rape victim, taking charge of the receptions at the police stations.The SSP had started to give active powers to women while appointing them as SHO of a police station at Patiala. He had later experimented with the concept at Ludhiana last year, when Division number 7 was headed by a woman.The brief spell of woman power, however, was broken within few months.Senior officers say that deputing women at receptions of the police stations is an advantage, as they can maintain more transparency and can deal with victims and the complainants in a better fashion. Jalandhar's DIG Rohit Chaudhary had started the practice of appointing women at receptions in Ludhiana during his tenure, but the project was a non-starter.	1
"NEW DELHI: Notwithstanding a strong anti-war lobby and a possible UN veto, Britain on Saturday declared that it would go along with the US in case military attack became inevitable on Iraq ""outside"" the United Nations framework.Not many would ""shed a tear"" if President Saddam Hussein is replaced, it feels.""In the face of an unreasonable veto (of the second UN Security Council resolution for military action), we will be prepared to take action outside the UN framework,"" British High Commissioner Sir Rob Young said.But Britain would continue to ""very energetically"" try to bridge the gap within the Security Council, he said.He, however, stressed there was already a legal basis under the UNSC resolution 1441 which permits use of force if the Iraqi President failed to fully comply with its provisions to disarm.Asked about the opposition from several countries including India for a change of regime in Baghdad by outside force, Sir Rob said, ""nobody in my country believes that Saddam Hussein is going to do much more even if we give him another two to three months. He is not being serious about disarmament to date.""Accusing Hussein of trying to buy time to split the international community, the British envoy said, ""there should be no mistake that he has a long way to go before he satisfies the UN weapons inspectors or the international community"".He said, ""if Saddam goes in the process and is replaced, I don''t think many people would shed a tear"". Observing that India has had a ""very consistent"" line on Iraq, Sir Rob said it shared the view of the international community that the onus was on Hussein to ""fully"" disarm and cooperate with the UN inspection for weapons of mass destruction.Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had in his recent statement on Iraq in Parliament also made it clear that India saw the Security Council as the focus of future action, he said, adding, New Delhi has fully supported UNSC resolution 1441.To a question, he said, India has strong traditional economic and political ties in Iraq. ""It is quite right that India should play a role in the rehabilitation of Iraq and in its future economic development,"" he said.Referring to Sunday''s summit meeting of leaders from US, Britain and Spain, he said, ""there is still scope for diplomatic route"" to address the problem.""We are determined to try every possible avenue to address concerns in the Security Council to bridge the current gap in a way which would show that it remains united in pursuit of its objective of removing Hussein''s weapons of mass destruction,"" he said."	1

CHANDIGARH: The Congress on Friday staged a noisy walk out in the Haryana Vidhan Sabha in protest against the Speaker's decision to disallow its adjournment motion on Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal.Soon after the Question Hour, leader of the opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda (Congress) was on his feet enqiring from the speaker about the fate of his party's notice for an adjournment motion on the SYL.To this the speaker replied that he had recived government's comments on the motion and it was still under consideration. On this, Hooda retorted that it showed how serious the government was on this important issue which concerned almost the state. Former chief minister Bhajan Lal also joined him at this juncture alleging that it seemed that the government was trying to evade the issue.Disagreeing with them, the speaker later announced that he disallowed the motion as the issue involved was not a recent occurrence. Besides, the House had been discussing the issue in one form or the other for the last two days, commented the speaker urging the opposition members not to make an issue out of it.After the Congress members had walked out in protest against the speaker'sruling, CM Om Prakash Chautala intervened saying that the SYL was the lifeline of the state and the government was doing its best to get the canal completed at the earliest. He said the state was thankful to the SC for issuing notices to Punjab and the Centre directing them to inform it about the steps taken to construct the canal.Later, talking to mediapersons, Hooda said that on one hand the CM said that the House should avoid discussing the SYL because the issue was sub judice, on the other the governor had metioned about the issue in his address to the House. The House could discuss any issue, he observed alleging that the reality was that the government had done nothing concrete so far to press the Centre to complete the canal.Referring to controversial Casino Bill, Hooda said keeping in view the fact that the governor was not happy with the Bill and instead of giving his consent to it he had referred it to the President, the state government should scrap the Bill in the interest of the state and the people.	1

KOLKATA: Stung by vehement criticism from Opposition leaders and embarrassed at his own behaviour, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Sunday issued a written statement expressing regret for forgetting to stand up when the national anthem was played the combined police parade on Saturday.Bhattacharjee's conduct was reminiscent of a similar incident in Bihar last year.Laloo Prasad Yadav and his wife, chief minister Rabri Devi, had sat through the national anthem at a Republic Day function. Apologising for the lapse on his part, Bhattacharjee said, aI had no intention to show disrespect to the national anthem.aThe statement, hurriedly issued on Sunday afternoon, also said the CM offered his asincere regreta for the embarrassing mistake. On Saturday during the annual combined police parade at the Brigade Parade Ground, Bhattacharjee sat quietly in his seat as the police band played the national anthem. Governor Viren J. Shah, director general of police Dinesh Vajpai and other dignitaries stood at attention next to him. Bhattacharjee remained oblivious to the goings-on. The only times he stood were right at the beginning of the national anthem, to welcome Shah onto the dais and before resuming his seat.Though cameras clicked and senior police officials watched in stunned silence, no one dared tell the CM he should stand up. Later, angry Opposition leaders said Bhattacharjee had ashowed disrespect to the nation and should be punisheda. Trinamul general secretary Partho Chatterjee said the CM had adishonoured the national anthema and legal steps should be taken against him. aWe will ask him to explain his conduct at the parade in the Assembly,a he said. BJP state chief Tathagata Roy described the act as ashamefula.	0
"BHUBANESWAR: Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Sharad Yadav was manhandled and heckled by irate protesters here at the Biju Patnaik airport on Friday.""This was a politically motivated attack on me,"" Yadav told reporters later in the day.Yadav, who arrived here on a two-day visit to the state, was greeted with slogans asking him to go back to Delhi.The members of the Orissa Dhana Chhasi Surakshya Samiti, demanding relaxation on the FAQ of paddy in Orissa, surrounded his car.

PATNA: The NDA on Saturday submitted a memorandum to governor, Vinod Chandra Pande, demanding CBI probe into the murder of the BJP leader Satnarain Sinha at Jamaluddinchak under Danapur police station, allegedly by an RJD worker Ritlal Prasad Yadav on April 30 at Khagaul.The NDA has also demanded security to the family members of Sinha and an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh each to the slain BJP leader and one Arun Yadav, who was killed in the police firing.An NDA delegation led-by the state BJP president Nand Kishore Yadav told the governor that Sinha was killed under a conspiracy hatched by the ruling party. Those who accompanied delegation included, leader of the opposition in state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi, party''s chief whip Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha, Samata Party legislature party leader Upendra Kushwaha and its national general secretary Satish Kumar, BJP vice-presidents Kiran Ghai, Giriraj Singh and Vinod Narayan Jha.The memorandum demanded immediate transfer of Danapur DSP Mohammad Hasnain and officer-in-charge of Danapur police station Pramod Kumar to ensure an impartial probe.It also demanded establishment of a police picket at Sarari and stern action against police officials responsible for the firing.Talking to TNN, Nand Kishore Yadav said that the governor gave a patient hearing to the delegation and assured to take appropriate action in this regard. Yadav said that the delegation informed the governor that the ruling party had unleashed a reign of terror by extending patronage to criminal elements to perpetuate its hegemony in the state.The memorandum also included the names of those who were killed in the run up to the ''maharailla'', Yadav added.	1
NEW DELHI: The concessions for the power sector announced in the Budget will spur reforms but will not accrue any immediate benefit to the common man.The extension of the benefits of mega power projects to all upcoming units of 1,000 mw and above will benefit the state-owned generation utility National Thermal Power Corporation which is in the process of adding 20,000 mw capacity by 2012.It will also benefit the company''s Rs 5,000-crore push into the hydel sector.A mega power project status entails import duty sops as well as concessions in other levies. To that extent, the project costs would be lower.The Budget also slashed import duty from 25 per cent to five per cent on equipment for high-capacity transmission lines. This will benefit the Power Grid Corporation which is in the process of setting up a national grid.Though this is indicative of the government''s thrust on distribution reforms, the move is unlikely to spur private investment in the sector. This is because no investor will come forward unless the buyers of power - the state utilities - gain financial health.To encourage research in solar energy, wind turbine and hydrogen fuel, the Budget has allocated Rs 20 crore to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research for launching incentive driven research in these three fields.	1
"MUMBAI: Anna Hazare, the crusader against corruption, on Wednesday denied allegations that his trusts were ridden with malpractices and said their accounts have been properly audited over the years.Mr Hazare was replying to charges levelled against him by food and civil supplies minister Suresh Jain. Mr Hazare said that the accounts of the Hind Swaraj Trust and Brashtachar Virodhi Jan Andolan are all in order.""If the government feels that there is malpractice, it is free to institute a CBI inquiry,"" he said.Mr Jain had alleged that Mr Hazare''s Trust had received central government funds for the development of a training centre in Ralegaon Siddhi before it was registered in April 1995.When told that the Hind Swaraj Trust had not submitted its accounts for three years to the charity commissioner''s office, Mr Hazare said that the trust''s chartered accountant had informed him that the report had already been dispatched.""But, if the chartered accountant has not still sent the audited accounts to the commissioner''s office, it is not our fault. Anyway, does this amount to corruption?"" he asked. Mr Hazare claimed that the allegations against his trusts are not new. ""These same charges were levelled against us when we carried out a campaign against two Shiv Sena ministers a few years ago,"" he said. Manohar Joshi had ordered an inquiry against the Hind Swaraj Trust when he was chief minister.""But, nothing wrong was found,""Mr Hazare added.When asked when his tiff with Mr Jain would end, Mr Hazare said, ""It will only end when either I go to jail or the minister resigns from his post.""Both Mr Jain and Mr Hazare have accused each other of corruption and have filed defamation cases against each other.He said that he would launch his anti-corruption crusade at the August Kranti Maidan on August 9 despite the government''s appeal to him not to go proceed with his plan."	1

"NAGPUR: There was no need for mediation between VHP and BJP on the Ayodhya issue as there was no discord between them on the matter, RSS joint spokesperson Ram Madhav said on Thursday. Briefing mediapersons here on the eve of the three-day RSS Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha meet, he remarked that both VHP and BJP leaders were mature persons. Hence, there was no question of RSS exercising any control over them.He also justified VHP's style of handling the issue saying it was perfectly in accordance with accepted democratic norms. At the same time, the BJP-led NDA government was not to be blamed for the delay in settling the issue, he added. ""Though there is some delay, there are several factors like petitions pending before the courts"", Madhav said. He equated Sangh Parivar outfits with mythological characters of Pandavas of Mahabharata. ""We are like panch pandavas, each one of whom was known for his characteristic style. Like them, each parivar outfit has its own style of articulation. There is nothing wrong in it"", he said."	0
"HYDERABAD: Poor security at different places maintained by the HEH The Nizam's Trust has led to antiques and other pieces of religious significance being often stolen from these premises.The city police have identified six places where the security is in a shambles. The places include Khilwat, Purani Haveli, Panjeshah Ashurkhana, Bibi-ka-Alawa, Badshahi Ashurkhana and Hazrat Abbas Ashurkhana which are all maintained by the Trust.Some more heritage sites are likely to be added to the list after a thorough review, according to officials.The security personnel presently manning these premises belong to the families of the employees of the sarfekhas a"" a department serving the families of nawabs during the reign of the Nizams. These families continue to serve at various places maintained by the Trust as a hereditary practice.Apart from the poor security, even the guards are very old. For instance, the two security guards, Mustafa Ali and Wali, posted at the Aza Khana Zahra in Dar-Us-Shifa are over 80 years old. It was from here that the Bibi-ka-Alam was stolen on Friday night. Even a few months ago, the officials of the Trust had been asked to replace the old security guards at Bibi-ka-Alawa. But no action was taken by the Trust, additional commissioner of police A K Khan told The Times of India.With several holy relics and antiques preserved at these places, there was an urgent need to tighten security, Khan said. Home minister T Devender Goud is also scheduled to hold a meeting with the city police and officials of the Trust in a few days to discuss the security problem at these places. A strategy to check theft in the places maintained by the trust would be chalked out during the meeting, Khan said."	0

HYDERABAD: The chief minister accused the Congress of trying to gain political mileage out of the severe drought situation in the state by staging protests on the first day of the budget session of the Assembly.Addressing the Telugu Desam Legislature Party meeting, Chandrababu Naidu said the Congress had no concern for the people and was resorting to gimmicks to gain cheap publicity.He said the Congress leaders while blaming the government for inadequate drought relief, had also written letters to the Centre against the huge quantity of rice released to the state.Admitting that the drought was severe in the state, Naidu appealed to all the members to be in constant touch with the people and monitor the relief works. Naidu blamed the Centre for the inadequate drought relief and criticised the role of the central teams that were visiting the state to asses drought.The TDP supremo said during an interactions with PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he had requested the Centre to evolve a scientific method to asses drought and provide relief.Meanwhile, the TDP legislators decided to donate one month's salary for drought relief.	1
HYDERABAD: The Anti-Corruption Bureau and the vigilance and enforcement department have reported to the government as many as 1232 graft-related cases involving government officials. But the heads of various departments are going slow in taking action against the guilty. In the last few years the ACB has framed cases against 808 government servants and subsequently submitted the reports to the government.Action was taken against only four till March 2003. The 808 cases are regarding assets disproportionate to known sources of income, nabbing officials while accepting bribe and embezzlement of government funds. Similarly, the vigilance wing detected 424 cases and charged the officials with swindling and misusing several crores of rupees. However, the HoDs so far have acted only in seven cases. Till March 2003, the Commissionerate of Enquiries, another watchdog agency, had sought action against officers in 312 cases, but the bosses took action in 15 cases only. Likewise, out of a total 2,769 departmental enquiry cases, 5 per cent of the cases were disposed of by the heads. With regards to implementing the schemes announced by the chief minister too, the heads of various departments are giving them a miss. Naidu has announced 371 schemes till March 2003, but only 58 of them were looked into by the heads of departments. Taking a serious view of this, the chief minister has warned that action would be taken against the heads of departments if files were not disposed of in a time-bound frame. Naidu told the officers during the performance review meeting here that he had directed the chief secretary to monitor the corruption-related cases regularly.	0

This co-operation was stalled by Washington following the May 1998 nuclear tests at Pokhran. President George Bush and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had decided in November 2001 to resume nuclear safety co-operation.Meserve said his visit was part of the overall structural dialogue on nuclear issues between the two nations and aimed at furthering these ties."	1

Speaking to reporters after participating in the all-party meeting held on Friday to discuss the GO 610 issue, BJP floor leader N Indrasena Reddy said that all parties unanimously asked the government to implement the interim report of the House Committee.The floor leaders wanted the government to prepare a common seniority list after repatriating the non-locals as per the recommendations of the interim report. Indrasena Reddy said that home minister T Devender Goud, who convened the meeting, assured to implement all the recommendations of the interim report, except in two cases of transfers where the affected parties have filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court judgment. However, the opposition parties wanted the government to implement the High Court order as the Supreme Court had not issued any stay order, he said. The floor leaders also cornered the government on two cases of transfer of police inspectors to the Hyderabad range. The home minister assured that an enquiry will be ordered into the two cases. MIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi said that the implementation of the report would create 600 vacancies of police constables. CPM floor leader Nomula Narsimhaiah alleged that the government was trying not to implement the recommendations of the House Committee as it was not sincere on resolving the issue. However, Devender Goud told reporters that the government would implement the House Committee recommendations and would seek opinion of the advocate general to avoid legal complications on the issue.	0
LUDHIANA: With a view to curb the malpractice regarding submission of fake certificates by candidates for recruitment into the army, the army recruiting authorities have decided to approach Punjab School Education Board (PSEB).Disclosing this, deputy director general (DDG) recruitment, Punjab and J&K, Brigadier Ajay Pahwa told TNN here that the problem has reached a level that requires effective intervention of the PSEB that conducts the matriculation examination and issues certificates to the successful candidates.''I will meet the PSEB secretary shortly in this regard as the matter is already is in their notice,'' he said, while asserting that the responsibility of curbing this practice lay with the state education board to which such doubtful cases are sent every quarter.Giving more details at the ongoing recruitment rally site here, Brigadier Pahwa said that PSEB has already confirmed the five cases referred to it by the Ludhiana branch recruiting office as fake after these were found doubtful during the scrutiny. As reported in these columns recently, these cases belonged to Ropar district along with reports of similar incidence from other recruitment centres in the state.On future course of action, the DDG said the documents were still with PSEB authorities. ''We will report to the police for action, should the candidates involved come to collect them from our Ludhiana office,'' he asserted.When asked about the number of cases reported from the state, he said that all he could say (as there were no readily available figures) was that not all certificates are genuine. When asked, DDG said the practice makes their task of recruitment difficult since thousands of candidates appear for recruitment.Besides causing distraction, the task of getting their documents authenticated at the initial stage amounts to a wastage of time. It's for this reason only a random check is made at the rally site, he said, adding that a thorough checking is made at the time of dispatch and doubtful cases are sent to the PSEB.Normally about 8,000-10,000 candidates from hot stations like Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts appear for recruitment which comes down to about one thousand at the written test stage. More than two thousand candidates appeared for recruitment till the second day of the ongoing rally that will continue till April 20, officials said.	0
KANPUR: Former UP chief minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rajnath Singh, on Saturday, yet again took side with jailed Kunda legislator Raja Bhaiyya and said that Pota should not have been slapped on him.He said this during an informal chat with local reporters during a brief stop over before proceeding to Jalaun where he was scheduled to attend a function.Defending the incarcerated legislator, Singh said that the manner in which he was arrested and the humiliation was heaped on his family was untolerable. He successfully evaded direct questions on chief minister Mayawati, differences with whom have time and again strained the delicately balanced relations between the BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party, and said that the would prefer to keep mum.He announced that the party would go all alone in the fortcoming assembly polls in four states. He welcomed prime minister''s offer to start talks with Pakistan and added that mused that it was the last opportunity for Pakistan to mend its way and develop healthy relationship with the country.Earlier, he was received by minister of state for urban development Satish Mahana and a host of party leaders at the Kanpur Central.

HYDERABAD: A man, who attempted suicide by consuming poison on Balanagar police station premises, died at Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences (Nims) on Wednesday.The man, G Chinna Anjaiah, 45, a resident of IDPL Huts in Balanagar police station limits was taken into police custody in April after the residents of the locality lodged a complaint against him alleging that he was creating nuisance.Anjaiah, who was allowed to meet his wife on April 18 morning, consumed poison on the police station premises and fell down. He was admitted to Nims where he died on Wednesday.Asked whether any action would be taken against the Balanagar police officials, Cyberabad police commissioner M Mahender Reddy told The Times of India that Anjaiah died due to a cardiac problem.He admitted that Anjaiah had consumed poison on the police station premises but his death was not due to consuming poison. Even his wife Lakshmi gave a statement in the court saying that Anjaiah consumed only a few drops of a poisonous substance while the rest of it was thrown away and it was done to 'blackmail' the police, he said.He, however, said that the inquest was conducted by an RDO and the post-mortem was videographed as is done in case of a custodial death. aI think there is no need to take action against any official,a he said.	0

NEW DELHI: Reforms in the scam-prone stock exchanges are on top of the Union Cabinet''s agenda for its meeting on Thursday.The proposed amendments in the Securities and Contract Regulation (SCR) Act to convert stock exchanges into corporates and to delink the management and regulation of exchanges from their broker members, will be taken up for Cabinet approval.The exchanges will be managed by a board of professionals.The Cabinet will also consider certain amendments to the Depository Act in view of the changes in trading and settlement norms on stock exchanges and also to take care of the problem of delisting of shares. Market regulator SEBI has come out with delisting guidelines, but these need to be incorporated in the Act. Also, a number of new depositories have come up, necessitating suitable changes in the law.The corporatisation of stock exchanges and the separation of the regulatory and management functions of the exchanges from the trading interests of their broker-members are being seen as much-needed reforms to prevent irregularities in the market. These reforms have also been recommended by the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) which probed into the stock market scam of 2001.Stock exchanges in India such as the Bombay Stock Exchange were set up decades ago and despite changes, their organisational structures have not undergone reforms. The finance ministry has proposed amendments in the SCR Act of 1956 to ensure that stock exchanges can exist only in a corporatised and demutualised form.There are another set of amendments in SCR Act which will be considered for incorporating definitions of new financial instruments like derivatives. Futures and options in index and individual shares have been introduced a couple of years ago. Last week, finance minister Jaswant Singh flagged off trading of interest rate derivatives on the stock exchanges.The amendments to the Depositories Act of 1996 will accommodate the rolling settlement system already introduced in the stock market. The settlement period is being brought down consistently with the aim of achieving what is called t+1 settlement (settlement on the very next day) from the next financial year.	1
"PUNE: A severe resource and manpower crunch has hampered the functioning of the three labour and four industrial courts in the district, which attract nearly 5,000 new cases every year.The situation is so bad that the labour courts have been unable to send notices to the parties concerned in 500 new cases, filed in the past six months, as they have run out of postage stamps!An industrial and a labour court are awaiting appointment of judges for the last 10 months, while judges of two labour courts, who were transferred to the city recently, are awaiting clearance to start functioning.Speaking to TNN on Tuesday, Subhash Kale, president of the Labour Law Practitioners'' Association, Pune, said the district had been allotted three labour and four industrial courts on the basis of case load, number of industrial workers and growth in industrial area.However, a week ago, the government issued a resolution, ordering the shifting of one industrial court from Pune on the grounds that the case load had decreased.Kale stated that his association has opposed the move.""Pune district has a growing industrial area. Besides, the city is located in a progressive state like Maharashtra. We feel that any temporary drop in the number of cases filed is not sufficient grounds for shifting one court,"" he said.If the case load increased in the future, it would be a time-consuming job to get back the additional court, Kale pointed out. He also pointed out that vacancies in these courts had not been filled. ""The labour courts have been functioning without a superintendent for the past six years, forcing the judges to do all the administrative work as well,"" he said.The posts of bench clerks have also not been filled. To make matters worse, the courts have not received their annual grants from the government for the year ended March 2003, which were due in April last.Kale pointed out that the staff in industrial court no. 4 was inadequate and the judge was forced to take help from the staff of other courts for day-to-day functioning. This had further slowed the disposal of cases, and even the issue of notices to litigants had been delayed, he remarked.Worried by the deteriorating situation, the association submitted a memorandum to chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde when he was in the city on Friday.Copies of the memorandum have also been sent to the chief secretary, labour and industry secretaries, commissioner of labour and the Maharashtra labour and industrial court in Mumbai.The memorandum states that if the government did not strengthen the labour law enforcement machinery and provided adequate infrastructure and funds, any change in the labour laws would be rendered useless."	0
UNITED NATIONS: Unesco will be launching a major bid to recover priceless artifacts stolen from Iraqi museums following collapse of the maintenance Hussein regime and urged the Security Council to make it mandatory for all member states to ban their import.Noting that 97 nations have so far signed 1970 convention against trafficking in cultural goods, Unesco Director-General Koichiro Matsura told reporters on Wednesday that a Council resolution would be legally binding on all the 191 member states.The most important step in the effort to recover these pieces of art, he said, is to ensure that they do not leave Iraq in first place. Stressing the need for an international effort to recover looted antiquities, he said Unesco is negotiating with the United States on sending an assessment mission to Iraq this month.Matsura met Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday evening to discuss the issue.It is essential, he said, to establish a database of Iraq''s cultural heritage as soon a possible so that art dealers and others know which pieces had been stolen.The database, he said, would be distributed to soldiers to help them in recovering and protecting the antiquities. Besides, Baghdad, Unesco would like to visit other important cultural sites including Ashur, Nasara, Hatara, Masur and Basra.Unesco has already contacted the international police organization Interpol, World Customs Organization and the International Confederation of Art Dealers in this connection, Matsuura said.	0

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistani Premier Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali has ruled out chances of an immediate summit meeting between him and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and said that talks at the high level would take place after the meeting of foreign secretaries of both the countries.""No immediate meeting with Prime Minister Vajpayee is on my current agenda,"" Jamali said on Friday while talking to reporters at Village Kot Bullo, Sukkur in Sindh.Stating that efforts were underway to pave the way for holding talks between the two countries, he said, ""Let the meetings between the foreign secretaries of the two countries take place, after which the stage would be set for high level talks between the two countries"".Foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan were scheduled to attend the Foreign Secretaries'' meeting of the SAARC countries in Kathmandu.

"AHMEDABAD: A powerful blast ripped through portions of the dome of the Jalaluddin Baba dargah in the crowded Khanpur area of Ahmedabad at around 12.30 pm on Saturday. The blast is believed to have been caused by a crude bomb. Police officials said no casualty had been reported.No container or any shrapnels were found during the preliminary investigations.""We found some cellotapes and wicks"", said DCP (zone II) Vikas Sahay. These will be examined by the forensic experts to determine the exact nature of the crude explosive.But police officials said , ""It was some kind of mischief"", since the site is dominated by the minority community.Due to the impact of the blast, chunks of concrete flew in the air and fell on neighbouring houses as scared residents ran out in panic. The incident coincided with the visit of deputy prime minister LK Advani and chief ministers Ashok Gehlot, Digvijay Singh, OmPrakash Chautala and Ajit Jogi to the city, to Ahmedabad for a private function. The dargah and portions of the mosque, which is part of the Syed Abdul Wahab Roza compound, was damaged during the earthquake and is under repair.The mausoleum is believed to be some 400 years old and the blast happened just minutes before the afternoon namaaz was to be offered. Incidentally, none of the male members of the 1,000-strong neighbourhood of this clustered compound claimed to be around when the blast happened.""I was away at Ranip seeking a job"", said Munir, whose father, he said, is the imaam at the Syed Abdul Wahab Kadri mosque, adjacent to the mausoleum. Zarina Nawab Khan who was in iddat (mourning) on the death of her husband, saw a chunk of the cornice fall on the tin roof, but her daughter quickly swept away the debris, like most of the other women in the neighbourhood.Shirinbano, who has stayed here for 40 years, claimed that her window came off while Shabira said the glass top of her teapoy cracked with the impact of the blast. All of them stay within 15 feet of the dargah."	1
VADODARA: The boat capsize tragedy in Narmada river claimed lives of 16 pilgrims with one person still missing. Bodies of the victims were found half-buried in the slush on the banks of the river where the pilgrims were doing 'parikrama'. The bodies were recovered during search operations conducted by the local administration with help from residents of local villages.According to officials, the bodies were recovered at about 8.45 am from near the Koliad and Suvagam villages. While 14 bodies were found near Koliad, two were found near Suvagam. Accounts of the tragedy, given by survivors to the police, indicate that an unexpected high tide in the estuary of the river could have led to the tragedy. aThe boat overturned when big waves entered the vessel. It is said to have turned turtle two or three times. Most of the pilgrims in the boat were thrown into the water in the process,a said district superintendent of police, Amarsinh Vasava. Vasava added that those who survived the tragedy had held on to the remains of the boat and drifted along with it to the banks of the river. aOthers were carried away by the current of the river. Their bodies, barring one, were found during the morning search operations,a he said. Experts too point at the strong currents, prevalent in the Gulf of Cambay and the Narmada that opens up into it, as the possible reason for the accident. These, they say, are the potential trouble areas for boats. aThe current in the gulf as well as in the Narmada reaches to about 4 to 5 knots, which is considered to be very high,a says Professor Ganapathi of M S University's geology department, who has sailed along the Narmada part of expeditions conducted by the NCC. aThe mishap may have taken place between a high tide and low tide. In the Narmada, a number of factors create strong currents when the water ebbs during low tide. They include hydro-dynamic flow of the water back into the sea. During high tide, the water from the sea flows up the Narmada for almost 60 km upto Kabirwad. The natural gradient of the river and the height to which the tide rises, about six eight metre, all add the ferocity of the waters in the area,a adds Ganpathi. All the deceased, well as the one missing person were from Madhya Pradesh. None those affected by the tragedy were local residents. Sources added that the survivors of the tragedy were from West Bengal and Bihar.	0
"LUCKNOW: More than the defeat, the BJP is worried about 'unexpected' shift of its Thakur votes to its coalition partner the BSP in the wake of Pota-effect. Party state president Vinay Katiyar is more concerned about how and why Thakurs voted for the BSP in Gauriganj than the party losing prestigious Haidergarh assembly seat to the Samajwadi Party. ""The party had anticipated that but we had never thought that Thakurs would shift to the BSP.This has caused concern and calls for self-introspection,"" stated Katiyar before leaving for Delhi to submit bypoll debacle report to the central leadership. ""It was a strategic mistake and miscalculation in Gauriganj and indifference of voters in Haidergarh due to VVIP status of the constituency. Though we managed to retain our vote share but defeat at both places has come as an eye-opener,"" added Katiyar. The party's poor performance will be analysed threadbare at the two-day state executive, beginning March 8. The party state chief hinted that some harsh decisions would be taken in consultation with the party high command to restructure the party organisation and bridge the growing gap between the coalition government and the party. Chief minister Mayawati's view that both coalition partners could have made adjustment to fight one seat each was dittoed by Katiyar but with a rider. ""True that we could have won one seat each, but the loss has removed some misunderstanding,"" said Katiyar. Elaborating his point, Katiyar claimed that contesting separately had at least exposed the strength and weakness of both ruling partners. Katiyar view's are clearly aimed at another round of rethinking on the contentious issue of continuing the alliance with the BSP. On former chief minister Rajnath Singh's reported statement that the party would have won Haidergarh seat if a member of his family was given ticket, Katiyar stated that ""Rajnath Singh was offered the ticket for his family members but he rejected it."" The BJP state president claimed that even Rajnath Singh had made a mention of it during one of his meeting in Haidergarh during electioneering. ""I don't know what Rajnath had said but the ticket was offered to one of his family members,"" disclosed Katiyar. Meanwhile, both Katiyar and the BJPLP leader Lalji Tandon have welcomed the opposition's decision to withdraw resolution seeking removal of the speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi. ""It had to be withdrawn as they did not have the numbers and their resolution would have got surely defeated on the floor of the house. Moreover, voting in the house would have got them exposed in the public eyes,"" reacted Tandon. ""A late but sensible decision,"" reacted Katiyar claiming it had saved the opposition from facing disgrace in the house. The party state president said that baseles allegations against Speaker's office was against the spirit of the parliamentary democracy. ""We welcome the opposition's repentance even though it came a bit late,"" said party spokesperson Dr H N Dixit."	1
LUCKNOW: When a minister in the state government calls the police to help an arrested mafia don, it no longer makes a news as such incidents are common with the speedy criminalisation of politics.But when a minister hounds senior police officials to rescue a listed thief who once carried a cash reward of Rs 10,000 on his head, accusing the men in uniform of making a acriminala out of an innocent, it surely did made news.It happened on Saturday morning when the special team of SP West intercepted a youth riding a Hero Honda motorcycle near Bans Mandi. He was brought to the local Naka police station when he failed to produce the registration papers of the vehicle. Here one of the constables identified him as Praveen Verma, a resident of Priyadarshni Colony.With a series of criminal cases pending against him, Praveen once carried a cash reward of Rs 10,000 on his head till he went to jail and was released recently. Interrogation revealed that the motorcycle recovered from his possession was lifted from outside Indira Bhawan on May 24 and a case was lodged in connection with the incident with the local Hazratganj police station.Barely had the police begun interrogating Praveen for his role in other similar cases when a BSP minister in the Mayawati cabinet came to his rescue. Contacting senior police officials, the minister gave a dressing down to the officials accusing them of making a criminal out of an innocent man. Had it not been for a few journalists who came to know about the arrest of Praveen, the police officials might have let him off the hook. But finally he had to be arrested for auto-lifting and send to jail.	0
"<div class=""section1""><div class=""Normal"">NEW DELHI: For all his efforts to solve the Ayodhya imbroglio, the Kanchi Shankaracharya seems a rather unwanted entity for both the warring factions. <br /><br />On Monday, both the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board disowned the seer''s efforts. While the VHP has termed him a mere ""tool of the government"", the law board made clear it did not recognise the seer as a mediator in the matter at all.<br /><br />The VHP was out all guns blazing, with a full parishad bench lashing out at the Centre''s latest Ayodhya initiative.It accused the BJP-led government of ""defeating"" the Ram Temple movement of crores of people by and ""selling out"" to ""jehadi forces"" with an eye on the next Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. Also that it was keeping the Shankaracharya in the dark. <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.indiatimes.com/talkradio/16junevhpnew1.wma"">Praveen Togadia</a> set the tone for VHP chief Ashok Singhal to make his point. ""The Centre''s current effort is aimed at defeating the Ram Temple movement and restoring the Muslim veto in Indian politics. They are telling the Muslims to take whatever they want, but give them credit for constructing the Ram Temple so they can use it to win the next elections,"" Togadia said.<br /><br />The government, he said, was trading the Ram Temple with the opening up of 1,000 ASI-protected mosques for namaaz, giving nine per cent reservation to Muslims in government jobs, and was giving up the Hindu claim on Kashi and Mathura.<br /><br />Terming as the height of generosity the fact that Hindus had demanded only three of 30,000 destroyed temples, Togadia said, ""Mathura, Kashi and Ayodhya are non-negotiable. Kashmir too is non-negotiable."" He added that a government that ""could compromise on Kashi, could also compromise on Kashmir.<br /><br />Demanding that the government make a full disclosure of whom it was talking to, Togadia alleged the Centre was in touch with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the Shahi Imam of Delhi''s Jama Masjid and Nadwat-ul-Uloom.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.indiatimes.com/talkradio/16junevhpnew2.wma"">Singhal</a> pointed out that the BJP had committed in its manifesto that it would build a Ram Temple and if it did not pass a law for this, it should quit and seek a fresh mandate.<br /><br />The Muslim Law Board also seems in no mood for any compromise formula. Prominent leader Syed Shahbuddin told <span style="""" font-style:="""" italic="""">Times News Network</span> that though they had said they would give due consideration to any written proposal made by the seer, it in no way meant that ""we will negotiate with him"". <br /><br />He pointed out that in 2002 though the Shankaracharya had said he would give things in writing he did not do so. ""Once bitten twice shy,"" Shahbuddin said, adding that the law board''s resolution was clear that negotiations would only take place with the government if at all. ""Even though we know the government is in the hands of the VHP.""<br /><br />""But this does not mean we are ready for any engagement with the Shankaracharya, whom we do not consider a mediator at all."" <br /><br />Shahbuddin said though the Shankaracharya had met the AIMPLB president and noted Islamic scholar, Maulana Rabe Hasan Nadvi, ""Ayodhya was not even mentioned for the first 45 minutes.""<br /><br /></div> </div>"	0

"NEW DELHI: In the wake of allegations that the Intelligence Bureau was trying to tarnish his image, Chattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi would be soon be questioned by the CBI to clear the air. The CBI has already written to the chief minister asking for ""some time"" so that some questions could be asked to him about the allegations levelled by him that the IB unit in Raipur was trying to target him deliberately under a plan code named ""Operation Black Sea"", highly-placed sources said here.The sources said his co-operation was necessary to reach to the bottom of the case. The sources said the CBI was investigating first to determine the authenticity of documents furnished by Jogi in connection with his allegation that the IB had launched an ""operation"" to defame BJP's political opponents. Jogi had alleged that the operation, code-named 'Black Sea', had been launched by the IB special directorate to target Opposition leaders, including Congressmen like him, in the run-up to the election campaign in Congress-ruled states. Jogi had said, ""someone gave a photocopy"" of the ""operation"" launched against him in which it was alleged that he had a joint account in a Swiss bank along with his wife and had amassed money and property since he became the chief minister. The sources said some more aspects of the case were being discussed and questioning of some more people would be undertaken by the agency. The case has been accorded top most priority and a senior officer of the rank of deputy inspector general asked to head the probing team. CBI said the agency had registered a case under sections 417, 465, 468, 469 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code against unknown persons after receiving complaints of forgery of documents in the name of special directorate, Intelligence Bureau. The documents also alleged that Jogi's wife Renu had signed a memorandum of understanding with a Malaysian company with 50 per cent share and this company has a software venture in Bangalore. The agency registered a case immediately after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced that the entire matter and allegations levelled by the Chattisgarh chief minister would be probed by the CBI."	1
"LUCKNOW: Is the CB-CID working to crack the Madhumita murder case, or all its attempts are just an eyewash? There were media reports on Monday, quoting the probe agency sources, that the sample of seven-month-old foetus of the slain poetess had been sent to Hyderabad for DNA test. The two labs in Hyderabad for this purpose -- the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) -- however were yet to receive any sample till late on Monday evening.Given the short time-frame that the CB-CID has been given to file the final report in the case, if it takes more than two days for the all-important sample to reach the lab, the seriousness with which it is being handled can very well be gauged. Or, this dilly-dallying is a desperate bid to save someone's skin? Director CCMB Dr Lalji Singh confirmed that he had been contacted by the CB-CID probe team. ""But, I had directed them to send the sample to CDFD, which had been set up specifically for DNA fingerprinting two years ago,"" he said while talking to Times News Network from Hyderabad. When CDFD director Dr Syed E Hasnain was contacted on Monday night, he informed that the centre was yet to receive any sample till Monday evening. ""And even if we receive the sample within a day or two, it will take two to three months to give the final report as we have a long queue of cases,"" he said before adding: ""It could be done on a priority basis only if we receive special instructions from the court to expedite the case. In that event, we can give the report in a week or so."" So, everything depends on when the foetus sample lands at CDFD. But, would the foetus sample without the DNA sample of the suspect to match it serve any purpose? ""I can make a comment only when I receive the sample,"" Dr Hasnain said.Dr Singh, however, points out that without the sample of the suspect the foetus sample is of no use. ""The lab won't accept it at first place,"" he says."	0
NEW DELHI: In an attempt to make water available to those living in upper storey houses, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has started supplying water late at night.''It is a hit and trial attempt. But we have to do it because some people remain perpetually without water, while some others get a lot and waste it,'' said DJB member (water) G C Nandwani.''Suppose there is a slot of three-hour supply to some area.We'll divide the supply into two slots. We supply for two hours in the normal time and then again after 10 pm,'' Nandwani said.He said the experiment's success would depend on how supportive the people are of this plan.''People who get a good supply should not turn on the taps when water is released in the second slot. That will ensure some water for those living in upper storey houses, or at the tail-end of the distribution network,'' he said.The concept has been tried in localities like Prashant Nagar, Mayur Vihar, Dakshinpuri Govindpuri and Gandhi Nagar. Depending on the local supply situation, it has been left to the area engineer's discretion to decide the supply slots, says Nandwani.But the system has some problems too. ''This is really a bad system. Many people go to sleep with their taps open and water keeps flowing through the night,'' says Asha Nehra of Govindpuri Extension.Though Nehra's house is located at the end of distribution network and at a level higher than other, still she was critical of the idea. ''Very few people can wake up at 3 am and then go to work in the morning too. I think it is impractical. They should rather increase the pressure and stop the illegal boring at the lower level areas,'' she said.Still late night supply is welcome in many localities where water never reaches during the day. But erratic timings compel people to spend sleepless nights and then they suffer during daytime too.Says Shikha Jain of Shanti Mohalla in Gandhi Nagar, east Delhi: ''The water supply can start anytime after 10.30 pm. If we aren't awake, then there is no water for the entire day.''Same is the condition of several other places where the meagre DJB supply begins as early as 3.30 am. If people don't wake up, they too miss storing any water.	1
"GHAZIABAD: Bypassing cruel ways, like burning, hanging or beating, to murder a bride for dowry which are usually easy to detect, a Ghaziabad sweet shop owner, allegedly, used a quack to kill his bride, Preeti (24).According to Ghaziabad police chief, Chandra Prakash, the guilty quack had been identified, and the woman''s husband and 10 in-laws have been arrested. A hunt is on to nab the quack. ""He will not be allowed to get away with such a diabolical a crime,"" claimed the chief.Police said the bride''s husband and in-laws were nabbed when they were taking Preeti''s body for cremation at dawn.Preeti, of Panipat, was married to Ajay, of Nandgram in Ghaziabad, in 1998. Since her marriage, she was regularly beaten up and harassed for more dowry, claimed the police. The desperate woman had even went home to Panipat last week, saying her in-laws were insisting on a motorcycle and Rs 50,000 in cash.However, two days back, Ajay fetched her back after Preeti''s parents assured him of fulfilling his demands. Apparently, Ajay was not convinced. So, he and his relatives conspired with a Muradnagar quack to give Preeti a poisonous injection as ''medicine'' for some minor ailment.But, one of Preeti''s neighbour phoned her parents that her body was being hurriedly disposed off. The parents phoned a top Ghaziabad official who had the funeral procession intercepted. Preeti''s body has been sent for an autopsy.In another incident of dowry death, a 27-year-old woman was allegedly killed on Saturday by her husband and in-laws for not bringing ""enough"" dowry. The husband and his mother, residents of D-319 Shahid Nagar, were arrested for demanding dowry and murder, the police said.The deceased, Bano, had married Tahir eight years ago. ""She often used to go to her maternal home in Bulandshahr as her in-laws troubled her for getting more dowry. Even a month-and-a-half before she was killed, Nano had gone home,"" said the police. But her husband persuaded her to return to Ghaziabad. On Saturday night, she was allegedly beaten up. ""Her in-laws turned on the volume of a TV set so that her shouting could not be heard. She was beaten to death,"" Bano''s family told the police. Her body had several injury marks. Tahir and his mother, Awsari, were later arrested."	1
NEW DELHI: Two persons, including a woman, were stabbed to death by two armed persons on Friday in northwest Delhi. According to police, the incident took place in the house of one Nand Lal Azad at D-44/A, Rama Vihar in Sultanpuri at about 3 am. Azad is an electrical engineer with the Delhi Development Authority and was not present in the house at the time of incident.Four persons were there in the house. They were Azad's wife, Meena (40), his daughter Purnima (21), son, Gulshan (14) and Gulshan's friend, Guarav (18). The police said Meena and Gaurav died in the incident, while Purnima is still in a critical condition. Gulshan escaped unhurt. Meena is Azad's second wife and Gaurav is the eldest son of Gobind Sharma, who stays in K-block in the same locality. The police have ruled out robbery as the motive behind the incident. Gulshan told the local police that two assailants entered the house and attacked the inmates with knives. As a result of the stab wounds, Meena and Guarav died on the spot, while Purnima was rushed to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Mongol Puri. The message has been sent to Azad at his native place in Uttar Pradesh and efforts are being made to contact other relatives of the deceased. Presently, Gulshan is under the care of the local police. The police said the mode of entry suggests it was friendly as there are no signs of forceful entry.	1
"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala government today ruled out a judicial inquiry into the ""police operation"" during the tribal agitation led by the Adivasi Gotrha Sabha at Muthanga on February 19.Addressing a press meet here after submitting a report to the Centre on the incident, Forest Minister K Sudhakaran said there was no need for such an inquiry as hundreds of local people were witness to the ''police operation''. He said several documents recovered from huts, which were put up by encroachers at Muthanga forest had clearly indicated that the ''armed struggle'' by Gothar Sabha leader CK Janu had received the support of ''some external forces"".The government would conduct a detailed investigation to find out who these forces were, he said, adding that the Sabha had been running a parallel administration in that area.Materials recovered included passbooks, passports, circulars and minutes of various meetings held by the Sabha and also an administration manual, he said.To a question, he said it was yet to be established if the agitation had the support of any extremist groups.He said the delay in taking action against the agitators clearly indicated the government''s ''soft approach'' towards them.He asserted that only one tribal was killed in the firing and challenged the opposition to furnish evidence, to prove that more had died.He also alleged that the Sabha had organised the stir with an ulterior motive, as they had chosen to encroach protected forest land."	1

CHANDIGARH: In a memorandum sent to Punjab governor O P Verma, state BJP president Brij Lal Rinwa has alleged that a senior IPS officer, during his posting in Ferozepur, was instrumental in rehabilitating people of a particular community in the border district. Rinwa alleged that a report prepared by party secretary Harjit Singh Grewal found that about 10,000 persons from the said community, many of whom were Pakistani nationals, were made to settle down in Ferozepur and places close to the Indo-Pak border under the patronage of the police officer in order to give a political twist to the demographic features in favour of the community.The officer, who was posted twice in Ferozepur in different capacities, also ensured a mushroom growth of mosques and 'mazaars' in the border region. Rinwa said even a large number of Bangladeshi nationals had also found shelter in the district. Demanding action against the police officer, Rinwa said this could pose a serious security threat in the region. The BJP president also expressed concern over the increase in incidents of conversions in the border areas. He asked the governor to direct the state government to take strict action against those who are forcing gullible people in border areas to convert from one religion to another under monetary influence.	0
NEW DELHI: The fuse is getting shorter. As Delhiites lose their patience over worsening water and power supply, the city police have identified over 25 ''potential trouble spots''. The flash-points which could erupt in rioting over these essential utilities include such upmarket enclaves as Vasant Kunj, Mehrauli, Defence Colony and Kailash Colony, as well as the middle-class areas of Gobindpuri, Okhla, Jamia and Ashram in south Delhi, Najafgarh, New Rajinder Nagar, Ranjit Nagar, Palam, Mukherjee Park, Nangloi, Inder Puri in west Delhi, Patparganj, Mayur Vihar, Acharaya Niketan and Kanti Nagar Extension.Expectedly lower income localities such as Seelampur, Karawal Nagar and Nand Nagri in the east also figure on the 'danger zone' map. Most of these places were without water for three full days, from May 15, and four-hour-plus power cuts are routine. The police fear that residents may reach a breaking point, and resort to violence. DCP (south), Vivek Gogia, said: ''In south Delhi, the power situation may get worse in areas like Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar, Madangir, Abul Fazal Enclave and Batla House in Jamia, Okhla, Ashram, Kailash Colony and Sunlight Colony.'' To defuse any potential eruption, the district police control room has been directed to be on the alert against any road blockages. The local police has been asked to step up liaising with resident welfare associations in these troubled areas. Gogia said beat patrolling has been intensified and residents have been provided with the telephone numbers of the district police and PCR to call at the first sign of brewing tension. DCP (southwest), Tejinder Luthra, said: ''We function as a link between the affected residents and the power distributing companies and Delhi Jal Board regularly to avert any crisis. Fortunately, both sides listen to us.'' Another senior officer said: ''Preventive steps have been planned also because assembly elections are round the corner. Political leaders may try to exploit the crisis, and instigate residents to resort to violence and earn political mileage.''	1

PATNA: The police on Wednesday arrested Anil K Rai for impersonating an IPS officer of the Gujarat cadre here on the Bihar School Examination Board premises. Board deputy secretary Ramji Prasad lodged an FIR with the Kotwali police station in this connection.Narrating the incident, a board official said Anil, who identified himself as the son of aretired home commissioner B Raia, had come to collect the duplicate certificate of his matriculation examination from the counter on the board premises.When the counter clerk asked him to show his identity card, he said that he was an IPS officer and that he wanted to meet the chairman of the board, the official added.aAnil, who was inebriated, sent to the board chairman a handwritten slip in which he claimed to be an IPS officer,a said the official.According to board chairman Subhash Sharma, while talking to him Anil said that he had received police training at Panipat and Chandigarh and that he had served as SRP at Vadodara and Katihar and as DCP at Paharganj (Delhi).

"PUNE: Films do not need fires for their complete destruction. An entire collection of over 100 film titles presented by the Czech embassy to the National Film Archive of India about five years ago is part of a huge collection of Indian and foreign films that is currently decaying and decomposing at the NFAI. The films are lying in two illequipped and stench-ridden storerooms called ""link-shed"" and ""tubular structure"" situated inside the NFAI premises.These storerooms do not have humidity control, air-conditioning and temperature control facilities, thus hastening their deterioration. An investigative visit to the stinking shed revealed a squalid picture of corroded film cans, dust-caked film reels, unsorted film consignments, dented film-reel trunks and a lineage of fluttering bats and trotting rats. Same was the story of the two storerooms near the FTII main theatre, occupied by the NFAI to store film materials for the last one decade.I&B ministry joint-secretary (films) Anjuly Chib Duggal told TNN that she had seen the link-shed area during her visit to the NFAI and FTII following the devastating fire on January 8, 2003. ""But the understanding given to me was that all scrap and decomposed material was stocked there. Nonetheless, I have instructed NFAI officials to sort out and shift the film material stocked at the link-shed to a safer place at the earliest,"" Duggal said. NFAI acting director K S Sasidharan said a majority of the material dumped in the link-shed was scrap material. ""Our officials are on the job a"" they are doing a detailed inventory and also weeding out decaying film material. In fact, a local level committee has been appointed after the recent fire to check the value of each and every film material, which is being sorted out,"" he said. However, sources told TNN that a lot of film material acquired by the NFAI was not even sorted and registered in the NFAI inventories. Meanwhile, the FTII has annulled the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the NFAI last October for allotment of a one-acre plot for construction of new film vaults. A letter issued by the FTII to the NFAI on February 5, 2003, formally terminating the MoU suggested that the new vaults for nitrate-based films at Paud road could be modified to store safety films. In yet another development, the inquiry report on the January 8 FTII fire submitted by I&B joint secretary (policy and admin.) Sudhir Sharma was rejected by the ministry as it lacked ""technical details"". Duggal told TNN that a fresh report with full technical details has been sought by the ministry."	0
PATNA: The spate of kidnapping in Bihar rocked the state legislative assembly here on Thursday during zero hour with the opposition, mostly comprising BJP members, trooping into well of the House and demanding resignation of the government. The matter was raised by some BJP members, with Prem Kumar pointing out that in a very short time there were eight incidents of kidnapping.The kidnapped persons included senior Nationalist Congress Party leader Salauddin, he said and charged the state government with lack of concern in the matter. At this juncture, all the BJP members were on their feet. Levelling various charges against the government, they went into the well of the House and demanded the government's resignation. They raised slogans like Down with Bihar government and Stop kidnapping. Leader of opposition Sushil Kumar Modi said that kidnapping in Bihar had assumed alarming proportions. The ransom money payment had touched a figure of about Rs 300 crore per annum. Parliamentary affairs minister Ramchandra Purbey merely said that steps were being taken to free the kidnapped persons from their captors. During zero hour, the opposition members criticised urban development minister Shri Narain Yadav for his failure to control mosquito menace in the state capital. The minister deliberately said, Why do mosquitoes bite the BJP and Samata leaders. At this, leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi quipped that a separate minister is needed to tackle mosquito menace in the city. Some members said that mosquito menace had become an all-Bihar phenomenon. The Speaker said that nothing had been done to clean the city and control mosquito menace in the MLA flats area. He asked the minister to get the city cleaned and check mosquito menace by sprinkling of insecticides.	0
SRINAGAR: Security forces have arrested seven militants and seized huge quantity of arms and ammunition in two different operations here since Sunday night, an official spokesman said.Security forces raided different hideouts of Hizbul Mujahideen in downtwon Srinagar following the arrest of the deputy district commander of the outfit, Tanveer Ahmad Khan alias Umar, from Khanyar.Based on the information provided by Khan, security forces netted four militants, Shakil Ahmad Khanday, Jehangir Salim Khan, Bilal Ahmad Kaling and Qaiser Farooq Gilkar, the spokesman said.This group was responsible for a series of grenade attacks on security forces and civilians in the city. In another operation, security forces arrested the district commander of Al Jehad militant outfit from his Nawakadal residence.In Jammu, two Pakistani militants lodged in Kotbalwal jail went on a hunger strike on Monday, demanding their return to Pakistan. Zulfikar Ali and Shabir Ahmed demanded they be pushed back to Pakistan, said the police.

VADODARA: Plans for agitation to protest collection of toll from residents of villages located in the vicinity of the Chhani railway overbridge gained momentum, with the villagers forming a common front to conduct an agitation over the issue. The villagers plan to form a human chain on Saturday to protest against the collection of toll tax from them.Leaders of villages like Dashrath, Chhani, Padamla and Ranoli, located on the national highway and near the overbridge, have formed the Vadodara Gramya Nagrik Hitrakshak Samiti (VGNHS) to conduct the agitation. These villages have, on several occasions, raised objections against the collection of toll and argued that they should be exempted from the same. A memorandum over the issue was submitted to the district administration here recently.Last week's incident of alleged manhandling of a resident of Dashrath village, Jitendra Patel, by police officers and security personnel of the toll booth has aggravated the situation. Nilesh Patel, a functionary of VGNHS, said that the villagers would now raise the demand for a service route so that they can bypass the overbridge.  aWe will form a human chain and the agitation will continue till the issue is solved. The purpose of the newly-formed organisation is to bring people together for the agitation,a Nilesh said.Senior police officials visited the over-bridge on Friday and met the leaders conducting the agitation and inquired about their demands and the future course of action. Sources said that the police is taking no chances after two successive incidents of vandalisation at the toll plaza located on the bridge.The villagers are also demanding action against Chhani police inspector Bhagirathsinh Jadeja for his alleged misbehaviour with Jitendra Patel. Nilesh said that the demand for action against those involved in the incident had been raised, but was yet to be attended to.Jadeja, meanwhile, said that the incident was being blown out of proportion. aIt is true that we had to physically lift the person from the place as he was obstructing traffic and leading to inconvenience to commuters. However, he was not beaten up,a Jadeja said.	1
"MUZAFFARPUR: Hoarding and blackmarketing by small cylinder sellers, together with oven mechanics running a parallel ""grih seva"" service, has created a man-made scarcity of LPG at Muzaffarpur these days. They are virtually thriving on the LPG procured from IOC dealers, making a profit of Rs 120 from every cylinder.The maximum cost of 14.5-kg LPG bottle refilling is Rs 255, which makes the per-kg price below Rs 17.But when these small cylinder sellers sell it, the price goes to Rs 100 for 4 kg, making it available to the consumers at Rs 25 per kg. Therefore, they and their men create such a scene at the gas distribution site that innocent customers are deprived of the LPG even during normal supply days.Moreover, these small cylinder sellers take full advantage of the pilferage of LPG by truck crews carrying cylinders from gas bottling plant at Ara to the godowns here. While taking out gas from cyliners on the way, washers of the cylinders are damaged. When customers detect leakage in gas at the time of using it, they have to take the help of oven mechanics, who charge Rs 10 for every washer and Rs 5 as service charge.As at least 25 per cent of the bottled gas is pilfered and one cylinder of gas lasts for 10 to 15 days only even in a small household, and then the victims have to take the shelter of oven mechanics and obtain one large cylinder for Rs 300 or more, depending on the graveness of the crisis. The IOC does not seem to be getting much cooperation from the concerned administrative officials in laying hand on the pilferers. Therefore, the oil company and its dealers have virtually surrenderfed before the pilferers. IOC sources, however, claimed that the incidence of pilferage has declined after the use of plastic cover on the cylinder nozzle.The IOC has got half-a-dozen LPG dealers and Hindustan Petroleum has one at Muzaffarpur. Of them, the BSFC, a state government undertaking, has the highest number of about 18,000 customers. It requires at least two truck-loads of LPG cylinders everyday, but most of the time, it gets only one truck carrying 300 refills. As on Saturday, the agency has deposited Rs 6.45 lakh with the IOC in advance and it was sending a draft of Rs 7 lakh the same day for 10 more loads. But the IOC seems to be sure to supply only 30 truck-loads every month.In the absence of the presence of police, the distribution site of Orient Club ground from 6 am to 8 am looks like a fish market. Innocent customers have no say at all. The cylinders are loaded on vendors'' tempoes, who charge Rs 265 from every customer for the supply of every cylinder as against the actual price of Rs 255."	1
PATNA: As many as 11 prisoners managed to escape from police custody in two different incidents here on Tuesday.In the first incident, nine prisoners, booked under robbery, rape and other cases, escaped from the court's lock-up room in Patna. The prisoners had been brought to court from Beur jail for production and managed to escape from the lock-up by breaking the lock.Their escape was noticed out at around 4 pm, when the police took a count of prisoners before taking them back to Beur jail.The escaped prisoners are Jaddu Paswan of Khemchuk, Manoj Kumar of Sitamarhi, Taja Ahmad of Bakerganj, Patna, Sambhu Yadav of Aurangabad, Prem Kumar of Adalatganj, Patna, Shaj Nawaz Alam alias Kalia, Munna Kumar and Ranvir Kumar, all of Jehanabad, and one Ajay Kumar. The police have sounded an alert to arrest the escaped prisoners and a probe has been ordered into the lapses resulting into the escape.In another daring escape, Madan alias Gabbar and Poonam Shah escaped from Danapur civil court campus on Tuesday. Both the criminals, accused of committing a series of murders and dacoities, were brought from Beur jail for production in Danapur court. According to Danapur police, Madan took out a pistol and terrorised the policemen in order to escape from their custody. Poonam Shah also escaped.	0
"PATNA: A team of National Dalit Rights Campaign (NDRC), Bihar, visited Dariyapur village under the Bihta police station of Patna district to conduct an inquiry into the Hardev Manjhi murder case recently. On its return, the team criticised the role of police in this case. The organisation blamed the Bihta police for deliberately avoiding any action against the main accused in this case.""The accused person has virtually unleashed a reign of terror in the area. Yet he is enjoying the patronage of the police. He was also involved in other crimes committed against Dalits in this area. He has even publicly humiliated a Dalit police officer who was earlier posted in Bihta PS. Apparently the local police does not dare to take on him,"" the team claimed to have found during its inquiry. According to NDRC, Ganhari Manjhi was assaulted publicly without any reason. His father Hardev Manjhi was also beaten so brutally that he died on the spot. But the police station refused to lodge a case under SC/ST Atrocities Act."	0
KOLKATA: A senior postmaster of the Alipore post office was caught while accepting bribe by the sleuths of the Central Bureau of Investigation on Saturday.According to court sources, a person from Kolkata had cleared the written test for the post of postal assistant.

In return, he demanded Rs 1.5 lakh.The applicant lodged a complaint with the CBI in Kolkata. The CBI sleuths advised him to strike a deal with Chattopadhyay. Accordingly, it was settled that he would pay Chattopadhyay Rs 10,000. The money was to be handed over at Babughat on Saturday evening. At the appointed hour, Chattopadhyay reached the place after office to receive the money from the candidate. Just as he was accepting the money, CBI sleuths lying in wait arrested him.	0
HYDERABAD: Congress Working Committee member and incharge of Andhra Pradesh Congress affairs, Ghulam Nabi Azad had a first hand experience of groupismin the party on Friday when APCC president M Satyanarayana Rao and senior leader R Narapa Reddy indulged in a wordy duel in Azad's presence at Gandhi Bhavan.Azad went to the PCC president's chambers after addressing a press conference around 6 pm and was taking to a group of leaders about holding 'unity meeting'.Narapa Reddy, who was present in Rao's chambers, asked Azad as to who would convene the 'unity meeting' and when told that the Pradesh Congress Committee will do it, he wondered whether the PCC exists at all. On hearing it, Rao lost his cool and reportedly poured his choicest invectives on Narapa Reddy.Starting from the airport, Congress leaders did their best to be in the agood booksa of Azad. Banners and buntings welcoming Azad were seen all along the roads leading Gandhi Bhavan.From airport, the scene shifted to Gandhi Bhavan, the APCC headquarters.

The CWC member had to personally intervene to keep slogan-shouting workers at bay. At one time, he shouted at PCC general secretary P Sudhakar Reddy.	0
KOLKATA: A consignment sent to the absconding Myanmarese tenant of former CBI additional director general Upen Biswas at his Salt Lake residence seemed to contain laboratory equipment for manufacturing drugs, said Narcotics Control Bureau officials. The 200-kg consignment comprised three packets. Biswas would be called to the NCB office for interrogation in a day or two in connection with the arrest of five foreigners with banned drugs from his house.According to an NCB officer, a parcel reached Biswas' house on Tuesday by courier. It was sent to S.N. Thanga, a Myanmarese hailing from Shillong, He was the local contact of the five foreigners -- three Myanmarese and two Chinese -- arrested on Monday with ephedrine hydrochloride. However, Biswas did not accept the parcel and sent it back. When NCB officials came to know of the parcel, they tracked it down to the courier service. It contained information about a consignment sent to Thanga from China by the drug racket kingpin Ah Hua. We took away the papers regarding the consignment waiting at the Kolkata airport. We have informed the customs officials that we would collect the consignment on Thursday, said an NCB official. Meanwhile, two employees of the Mizoram handicrafts emporium, H. Lalawi Zauva and Lalthan Pui, detained by the NCB for interrogation said that Thanga had approached them for an accommodation in the city. They had found him the house in Salt Lake purely on good faith. But, the Mizoram government letterhead used for Thanga's recommendation seemed to be forged. Lalthan Pui was released on Wednesday but she may be called again for further probe. H. Lalawi Zauva is still under detention. NCB officials were alerted about the use of ATS, made from ephedrine hydrochloride, when about 75,000 tablets were confiscated in Imphal last month. The use of the psychotropic drug is prevalent in South-East Asia and Europe. Soccer player Diego Maradona tested positive for ephedrine and was removed from the 1994 World Cup held in the USA. ATS addiction is on the rise in the North-East, NCB officials said.	0

"MUMBAI: Continuing its opposition to AICC President Sonia Gandhi''s bid to become the Prime Minister, NCP, Congress'' partner in ruling DF in Maharashtra, warned its ally of suffering ""heavy losses"" if it fails to forge a pre-poll alliance ahead of crucial Assembly and Lok Sabha polls.""NCP will not accept Sonia Gandhi as the Prime Minister but the decision pertaining to a pre-poll alliance should be taken setting aside this issue in the larger interest of the country to defeat communal forces,"" NCP Spokesman Vasant Chavan told a news conference here on Thursday.Incidentally, the former Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had in Nagpur recently asked the NCP to clarify its position vis-a-vis Sonia Gandhi''s bid for Prime Minister''s post.Chavan further stated that NCP has already extended an appeal to all secular-minded parties to join hands but it was yet to receive any response from the Congress.Referring to newly-appointed MPCC chief Ranjit Deshmukh''s statement that his party was aiming to contest 288 Assembly and 48 LS seats on its own strength, Chavan said if Congress and NCP fail to form an alliance then the former will suffer most as ""we will emerge as a single largest party"". Chavan said the state government should reconsider its stance about terms of references of Kurdukar panel, probing the controversial Dabhol Power Project. His statement assumes significance in the wake oft NCP President Sharad Pawar, state''s former Chief Secretary N Raghunathan and the Centre demanding amendment in the terms and references of the probe panel."	1

"HYDERABAD: Roads and buildings minister Tummala Nageswara Rao and TDP spokesman Ravula Chandrasekhara Reddy lashed out at Congress Forum for Telangana (CFT) leaders on Monday for their diatribe against chief minister and Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu.

If an online pump was found, the owners of the premises would be penalised Rs 2,000 and the pump would be confiscated.The city has a peak demand of 825 million gallons a day. But the administration is able to provide a maximum of 629 mgd of water to the residents.DJB chief P K Tripathi said, ''We are aware that quite a few people install online boosters.

Dikshit said, ''Nobody would be allowed to use drinking water supplied by the DJB for non-drinking purposes.''The fine for this offence would be Rs 1,000 with an additional daily fine of Rs 100 if the offence is continued. If shops and restaurants were found to be using a domestic connection for commercial purposes, a fine of Rs 2,500 would be levied. For shops bigger than 30 square meters, fine would be Rs 5,000.	1
"The media has been full of the President''s historic train ride in Bihar, and all the people he wowed, from the railway staff to Patna Patni No 1. But few know that there was a top-secret meeting between the Patna Pati and the Rashtrapati.This was not some sentimental Yadavon ki baaraat. Laloo wanted to upgrade the image of Bihar especially after the scientist-President''s recent rocket to its MPs.The state had once again been declared an absconder on development. Laloo could not understand why the state should be so unfairly branded, considering that every single Bihar politician was fully engaged in human development a"" his own. Everyone sneered that Bihar was synonymous with corruption. Laloo strongly believed that nothing could be fodder from the truth.Determined to impress the Prez, the First Husband had mugged up his daughter''s science text book. Then, having secured a private hour with the Missile Man, he launched into his trajectory like an ICBM. ""Mananiya Rashtrapatiji, we both had humble beginnings. While you gave India the big stick of defence technology, I have only a lathi. But, Sir, do not think that I am a peasant who has never been transferred from land to lab.""He continued ""Huzoor, I also have all the scientific theories at my finger-tips. Who else can recite anything backward with greater authority than I? Forget Newton, I even know Oldton. Puchhiye, puchhiye, ask me about any question.""The acclaimed Kalam smiled indulgently, and said, ""Achha, do you know about Einstein?"" Laloo spat out his response as swiftly as a squirt of paan-juice. ""Arre ho Rabri, come here and bring your brothers, Sadhu and Subhash."" He triumphantly presented them to the scientist, ""Ee hai bhaiyya, here''s my personal theory of relativity!""Kalam, always excited by ignited minds, warmed up. ""Do you know the Theory of Everything?"" Laloo preened, ""Theoory ka, I know even the practice of everything, from railla to mob rule."" The scientist patiently explained that this theory was about the oneness of all the forces of nature. ""You''re teaching ME?"" Laloo drawled. aI have rolled all forces of legislature, executive and judiciary into one!"" Now all charged up, the President shot out questions as in Mastermind, and Laloo responded like an unguided missile. Game Theory? ""As a politician, I have to think like my opponents to maximise my gains."" Big Bang theory? ""I started as a singular entity of intense density and see how I have expanded to create my explosive universe."" Black hole? ""My Mrs and I have made the whole of Patna into one.""Then, on winds of fire, the two swept through the cerebral swathe, culminating in a nuclear fusion of science and spirituality. Kalam quoted the paradox of ''Schrodinger''s cat'' who is ''dead and not dead'', and the corresponding duality in the particles and waves of quantum physics. Our poll-itican, who was eminently qualified to write an electoral rig veda, responded with the ancient verse. How did it matter if he said ''neta, neta, neta,'' instead of the original ''neti, neti, neti''? Both, after all, are about the negative path to the goal.At the end of the session Laloo composed a slogan, Jab tak rahega railla mein salaam, tab tak rahega Dilli mein Kalam. He then ordered the President, ""Repeat it after me.""* * * Alec Smart said, ""How should you attach pix of the solar shadow to your m@il? With e-clips."""	0

"BATHINDA: The arrest of two narcotics smugglers by the Amritsar police four days ago is likely to trigger off another controversy. The smugglers have reportedly confessed to their association with Narottam Singh Dhillon, a nephew of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.At a press conference late Friday evening, Muktsar SSP Surinder Pal Singh said Thana Singh, a smuggler, had confessed to the Amritsar police that Dhillon was their ""financier and partner"".The smugglers had also confessed to their links with J&K terrorists and ISI agents. Quoting the report sent by the Amritsar police, the SSP said they had number of hideouts in Rajasthan, Delhi and Punjab and regularly met at these places to carry out their activities.The report also stated that Dhillon was involved in various anti-national and subversive activities.Interestingly, while the Muktsar SSP claimed that a case was registered against Dhillon at Amritsar, SSP of Amritsar H S Sidhu denied this.Sidhu, however, admitted that Thana Singh had named Dhillon as his financier and had disclosed his links with the ISI and smuggling of weapons. But he said no case had been registered so far. Sidhu said the interrogation report was a secret document and it was not supposed to be made public.He said the report was sent to Muktsar police so that it could help them to dig out more facts about Dhillon. The Akali leaders here, however, said the Muktsar police were trying to use police ""revelations"" to get Dhillon''s police remand extended. Dhillon was remanded to police custody till July 5 for his alleged links with ISI, narcotics business and in a case of alleged involvement in counterfeit currency, which was registered at Lambi police station last month.SSP Surinder Pal, however, denied the charge. Muktsar SP Amrik Singh Waraich said he had no information about this case."	0
LUCKNOW: Six bonded labourers were rescued from their masters following a raid at Katka Khurd village in Sandila on Tuesday morning. This newspaper had higlighted the plight of the labourers as told by one of them, Gijraj, who had escaped after a decade-long nightmarish experience in the captivity of influential Thakurs.Ironcially, despite the recovery of six of them from the custody of the village pradhan Jaskaran Singh and his associates Rajendra Singh and Chandel Singh, no FIR was lodged about the incident with the local Attrauli police till late Tuesday.As the matter was related to labour law, the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Sandila, SP Singh, had to file his report on the basis of which action was to be initiated against the accused.However, the allegations are that the SDM was working a safe passage for the accused in consultation with the district labour Insepector (DLI) and was yet to submit a report with the police for further action. It has also been alleged that six persons were initially taken into custody out of whom three had already been set free. The accused, villagers claim, are closely associated to a influential politician of the ruling coalition.Efforts to contact SDM Sandila SP Singh, DM Hardoi and even commissioner Lucknow AK Singh proved futile. While the DM Hardoi was said to be in Sandila for some official work, the reporter was directed to contact SDM Sandila. When contacted, the office staff of SDM Sandila said, aSaheb chetra mein haina (SDM is in the field). The Commissioner Lucknow SP Singh, his staff claimed, had left to attend a marriage and expressed his inability to help in the matter.The DIG Lucknow Range AKD Dwivedi who was contacted for comments in the presence of the labourers in Katka Khurd village on Monday night had expressed his willingness to get the complaint verified by senior officers. A raid was ordered this morning and six labourers recovered. The DIG, told TNN that all of the rescued labourers had in their statement admitted that they were being exploited. Three of them, according to the DIG, were not even in their senses. aOne was even unable to identify the world around him and could barely identify a currency note,a Dwivedi said.It may be mentioned here that Gijraj was taken away by the pradhan of Katka Khurd some ten years ago from Charbagh and held captive. He was rescued with the help of a local villager pursuing his post graduation. Gijraj was brought to Peoples Union for Human Rights (PUHR) which verified his claims after a visit to the village. A letter was sent to the NHRC and a report sought from the CO Sandila. That is still to come.	0
NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry is concerned over attempts by several Left extremist organisations within the country to create ''compact revolutionary zone'' from Nepal to Andhra. A recent report of the ministry claimed that the Peoples War Group and the Maoists in Nepal are making efforts to spread to new areas and carve out the zone, which will run from Nepal to Andhra through Bihar.It said that the Maoist Communist Centre and the Communist Party Marxist Leninist-Peoples' War, both banned under POTA, continued to make ''strenuous'' efforts to increase their areas of influence, streamline their organisational functioning and militarise their underground apparatus.They accounted for 85.9 per cent of Naxalite violence and resultant deaths which stood at 482 last year against 564 in 2001. ''Their primary motive together with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) is to spread into new areas to carve out a 'compact revolutionary zone' spreading from Nepal through Bihar and the Dandakarania region to Andhra Pradesh,'' the report said.	1

"LUCKNOW: While promising to bring transparency in the overall taxation system, minister of state for finance Gingee N Ramchandran on Friday said that most of the states would introduce the Value Added Tax( VAT) from this year as part of the tax reforms. ""When we are moving towards a liberalised economy, the society would also follow suit,"" he said.After inaugurating the new building complex of the Direct Taxes Regional Training Institute, the minister said: ""The tax-paying system will become more transparent and we will concentrate on core sectors.""Coming to tax reforms, Ramchandran said that as far as direct and indirect taxes were concerned, several measures were being taken to streamline the system and ultimately to encourage voluntary compliance with laws.The tax reforms would continue to meet various situation that arise from time to time, he said. Praising efforts of the government in this direction, the minister said: ""While enhancing the standard deduction limit and removing the surcharge on income tax, we have initiated a package of well-conceived measures to make taxation more friendly.""Speaking about important reforms that would be taken up immediately, the minister said that the government would concentrate on core activities like revenue mobilisation, replacement of the present discretion based system for selection of returns.He said that by directly crediting all refunds to bank account of tax-payers the department had paid Rs 19,409 crore up to February 2003. This amount was Rs 5700 crore more than the last year's, the minister said.On direct tax collection, Ramchandran said that there was 17 per cent growth in 2000-01 over the previous years and it came down to 1.4 per cent in 2001-02 when compared to the previous years.In the current year, he said the gross collection was Rs 77,938 crore till the end of February 2003 against Rs 63,667 crore of last year.

"LUCKNOW: The state government is planning to approach Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh which are potential buyers of its agriculture produce. Besides, there is a plan to export more rice to Nepal and sugar and other commodities to Pakistan.Giving this information to Times News Network here recently, a senior official of the agriculture department said that consultations with officials of these countries would begin soon.The state government would also approach the Centre for the removal of impediments coming in the way of boosting trade ties with neighbouring countries, he added.Despite the fact that sugar and rice of Uttar Pradesh were in high demand in foreign countries, their export could not be boosted due to apathy of previous governments, the official said and added ""had the government met demands of those nations, it would have boosted foreign exchange"".Besides, the state government had also decided to apprise farmers about the requirements of international trade, he said and added if the government really wanted to compete at international level, it would have to achieve the production target of 571 lakh tonne of foodgrains. The state produces 432.36 lakh tonne of foodgrains every year. This quantity may be sufficient to meet local requirements but it is not enough to meet the global demand.At a meeting held at Krishi Bhawan recently, agriculture secretary AK Bit said that it was essential for the government to bring more areas under cultivation. As of now the state has 168 lakh hectare under cultivation. The secretary also felt that the state should expand cultivable land up to 171 lakh hectare.The official, however, expressed concern at the increase in the number of marginal farmers. The state has 2.16 crore farmers. At the meeting, the agriculture officials also laid stress on the need for strengthening the animal husbandry department for increasing agriculture production.Officially, 72 per cent of the work force in the state survives on agriculture and of this 19 per cent are landless labourers. Nearly 10 per cent of the people own 45 per cent of the land in the state."	1

MUMBAI: The Unit Trust of India (UTI) has announced a fresh package to woo US-64 investors to stay put after the Centre-sponsored guaranteed returns package expires on May 31, 2003.UTI chairman M Damodaran on Tuesday announced that all US-64 unit holders will have the option to convert their units to 5-year, tax-free tradable bonds that would effectively offer higher returns than other bonds of a similar tenure.The officials added that the government will announce a series of steps in this regard, including the coupon rate of these five-year bonds, though market analysts estimate this to be in the range of 5.5 to 6 per cent.According to UTI officials, it would make sense for an individual investor to convert his units to bonds as these bonds can potentially yield better returns.UTI officials said they expected US-64 prices in the secondary market to appreciate considerably in the near-term, because of this option of a 5-year tax-free bond. Trading in US-64 started on Tuesday and indicative bids were quoted in the range of Rs 9-10.''Since these bonds will be tax-free, banks, financial institutions and corporates will find this paper quite attractive vis-a-vis a similar government paper, which will have lower effective yields,'' said D S R Murthy, executive director, UTI.Damodaran has clarified that investors of US-64 eligible to convert units to tax-free, tradable bonds include those holding up to 5,000 units, those holding above 5,000 units (both classes have different assured returns from the government) and also those who buy the units from the secondary market. He has clarified that units purchased between November 11, 2002, and January 22, 2003, will continue to be traded and repurchased at the net asset value based price and will not be offered these bonds.The newly formed UTI Asset Management Company and the Trustee Company held its first board meeting on Tuesday. Discussions were held on operational details of UTI-I and UTI-II.

LUDHIANA: The unorganised small scale and tiny hosiery units seem to be in a combative mood over the alleged hand of organised textile sector in bringing this industry into the excise net as announced in the Union Budget recently.The matter came to head before ongoing three-day bandh observed by local hosiery industry against imposition of the new measure.During the meeting held at Shivpuri Mandir, knitwear, textile and allied industries (FEKTAA) president Vinod Thapar alleged that the Union finance ministry, at the behest of India Cotton Mills Federation (ICMF) comprising big players, took the unpopular step. More than 2,000 hosiery manufacturers attended the meeting.Talking to Times News Network, chairman, national textile committee, CII (northern region), SP Oswal dismissed the charges saying that the representations by their industry to the Union government in this regard had been going on for a couple of years demanding level playing field. Pointing out exemptions in the case of some processes, Oswal said their contention was to extend the duty which, for instance 12 per cent in the case of woven garments, to entire value chain. Notably, both segments had been involved in publicity war over the issue previously. The ICMF had, through the press advertisement, sought imposition of excise duty at every stage of production from cotton ginning to production of readymade and knitted garments. It was also projected that all CENVAT credit must be given only on the strength of proper duty paid documents with a view that an unbroken chain would ensure increase in the government revenue from the textile industry substantially.A quick rejoinder in the form of advertisement issued by FEKTAA had opposed this. They alleged that withdrawing exemptions on knitted fabrics and garments was a ploy to enable big fish to eat up small ones thus rendering millions of handloom weavers jobless. FEKTAA also maintained that weaving and knitting industries were entirely different in nature and infrastructure, contrary to what the ICMF claimed. While the latter being run in an organised way was managed by multinationals and big houses whereas the former comprised very small and tiny unorganised sector. Moreover, the SSI units would not be able to cope with increased formalities of the excise department.	1
"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan''s Opposition parties brought the National Assembly to a standstill as they rejected the controversial Constitutional amendments promulgated last year by President Pervez Musharraf and refused to accept its copies.After uproarious scenes late on Wednesday, Speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussain adjourned the 342-member National Assembly and asked the ruling and Opposition parties to reach an agreement on the issue. Opposition leaders later said they would continue their protests until the government agreed to delete the Legal Framework Order, under which the amendments were constituted, from the Constitution and bring the controversial presidential decrees it contains to Parliament for approval. The Opposition parties - former premier Benazir Bhutto''s Pakistan Peoples Party, deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif''s Pakistan Muslim League and Islamic party alliance Muthahida Majlis Amal have formed a steering committee to continue their fight against the LFO.The LFO legalised the referendum held by Musharraf under which he was elected for a five-year term and conferred him powers to dismiss the Parliament and the government. Trouble broke out in the National Assembly after the government for the first time distributed the copies of the amended Constitution containing the LFO. The issue remained controversial ever since the National Assembly was constituted last year as several members of the House took oath under the 1973 Constitution without containing the LFO. As the slogan-shouting intensified, Speaker Hussain adjourned the House twice to let ministers persuade the Opposition to end its protest. Finally, the Speaker adjourned the House until Friday -- giving a day''s time to come to terms. The Assembly witnessed unprecedented noisy scenes on Wednesday after copies of the Constitution containing the LFO were tabled in the House with Opposition members shouting ""no LFO, no"" and ""go Musharraf, go"". A woman member of the PPP stole the show by being the first to reach the Speaker''s rostrum and return the Constitution''s copy while Liaqat Baloch of the MMA denounced the LFO. For pro-military Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali said it backed the LFO and would not take it back. Information and Media Development Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the Opposition parties, by their protest on the LFO, had diverted attention from more important issue of foreign policy which was scheduled for a debate on Wednesday. ""In the current situation, I think the issue of Iraq was one of the important issues of the region which should have been discussed and the Opposition should have given fruitful suggestions to the government to take decision whether the government should support Iraq or not,"" he said."	1
KOLKATA: In view of the spate in activities of the Peoples War and the Maoist Communist Centre in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapur, the West Bengal government has decided to strengthen the intelligence network in Bankura district by creating new posts for sleuths.The decision would be finalised in the state cabinet on June 24. According to the official sources, posts of four inspectors and 10 sub inspectors will be created for the district intelligence branch.The fund-starved finance department had asked the home department to fill up posts with the surplus staff of the Kolkata airport police district or the fifth battalion of the state armed police. However, the proposal did not hold ground as there are no surplus staff available.So the home department has proposed to create all the additional posts citing urgency of the situation. Recently ultras exploded a landmine at Jhaldah in Purulia close to Jharkhand. Both MCC and PW have made inroads in the jangal mahals of Bankura-Purulia and Belpahari-Bashpahari zone of West Midnapur and killed some CPM activists. The judicial department has proposed change in the Criminal Procedure Code to stop the harassment of undertrials and curb corruption in the criminal justice system.The department has proposed to allow accused persons to offer 'money deposits or government promisory notes as security' before the courts instead of taking help of professional sureties. The present practice stipulates that designated persons stand as sureties on behalf of the accused persons assuring that they would be financially liable if the accused jumped the bails and refused to turn up in court.	1
"ISLAMABAD: In a cautious response to India's suggestion for sharing intelligence on the activities of militant groups, Pakistan on Saturday called for creation of a ""constituency for peace"" and said that such things could be considered ""if there was meeting of minds at the top"". In a guarded reaction to comments by External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha suggesting intelligence sharing under joint mechanism, Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Muhammad Kasuri said the two countries could do a lot of things together but a ""meeting of minds"" as necessary for such initiatives.""May be lot of things can be done. But what is more important is creation of a powerful constituency for peace,"" he told the Indian correspondents here over phone from Lahore. He said for such steps, ""a meeting of minds"" was required, specially between the leaderships of both the countries. Kasuri also said that Pakistan would appoint the High Commissioner to India soon. Pakistan Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali has told the media in Karachi two days ago that a decision would be taken on High COmmissioner to India in consultation with Kasuri. On the delay in the resumption of flight services between the two countries as well as Pakistan granting airspace, he said such things needed to be discussed by civil aviation officials on both sides, adding that such issues can be amicably resolved after appointment of High Commissioner."	0
"KOHIMA: The NSCN (I-M) has ruled out surrender of arms ahead of the next round of dialogue expected to be held abroad between the organisation''s leadership and the Centre''s special emissary K Padmanabhaiah later this month. Expressing regrets that ""irresponsible utterances"" from the Central government representative were still persisting, the NSCN (I-M) leadership in a statement on Friday said, ""it would be unfortunate for all if the atmosphere which was already essentially conducive to the process, was vitiated.""""It should be remembered imposition in any manner from either side will not work,"" the statement said.NSCN (I-M) alleged despite their statement on January 24, 2003, wherein they hoped ""the Government of India would appreciate the Naga''s sincerity, their firmness in their commitment to the process and their modesty, the Indian government has tended to presume upon it and is indiscreetly pushing towards arms surrender.""The statement said the Government of India should know it was not the ""time anymore to talk about the Indo-Naga issue out of turn,"" but to take a bold decision.They also reminded the Government of its solemn commitment that it would, ""not talk with any group except the NSCN"" and warned that ""failure to honour the commitment may therefore be disastrous, nay, it may bring end of everything.""Meanwhile, the Centre''s special emissary K Padmanabhaiah said earlier this week in New Delhi that the question of laying down of arms would arise only when a ""final settlement"" was reached."""	0

NAWADA: With a view to establishing peace in the violence-prone Nawada district, the district administration has taken steps to close the sources of income of the gangsters involved in the exercise. As a result, the police administration fished two puddles situated at Birnama village under Kashichak police station of the district on Thursday evening.Earlier, dreaded gangster Ashok Mahto had scattered fish seeds in about 45 government tanks, ponds and puddles at gunpoint with a view to earning a huge amount in three months. This had caused tension, including caste tension in the area. On getting information, the district administration conducted a survey of the ponds and banned fishing.Over the issue of the possession of the tanks, Ashok Mahto gang had attacked Bellarh village and opened several rounds of fire. Following the shooting incident, the then ADGP Ashish Ranjan Sinha had held a high-level meeting with district officials and issued directives to remove the possession of the tanks from the grip of the Mahto gang, thereby stopping their sources of income.According to the Nawada Sadar SDO, Nagina Sharma, on the directive of Nawada DM N Vijayalakshmi and SP Bacchoo Singh Meena, the fishermen fished 87 kg of fish from the two ponds which was sold for Rs 2,700.

MANSA: Once the name of complainant in the First Information Report (FIR) against Parkash Singh Badal''s family in the corruption case was exposed, Akali party leaders of Mansa area are up in arms against the complainant -Balwant Singh of Dhalewan village of this district.Balwant Singh is son of Sukhdev Singh who was a member of Punjab Pardesh Congress Committee.Balwant Singh was nominated as director, Barren Land Development Corporation, on June 19 and he had made a complaint against Badal''s family members to the chief minister on June 24.In a press conference at Mansa on Wednesday, senior Shiromani Akali Dal (B) leader Sukhwinder Singh Aulakh alleged that Balwant Singh was very close to Bharat Inder Chahal, the media advisor to the chief minister.

LUCKNOW: The Lucknow Municipal Corporation's (LMC) new compulsory scheme allowing residents to assess their house tax has perplexed them. Barring a few in the educated class, the scheme has made matters worse for others. Though the state government reversed the hike in house tax after the opposition by corporators, the new scheme has few takers.aPaying one's house tax is more of a problem now, since one has to go through drawn-out procedures,a said an irate tax payer while talking to Times news network on Monday. The detailed information demanded in the assessment form to be filled before paying the tax irks people.aThe form requires not only details like carpet area of the rooms but also of the road running adjacent to one's house. It is absurd,a said a tax payer.Even LMC's corporators have sandbagged the new scheme, and they feel it will not increase its revenue. aIt is a good way to hoodwink the people,a they add.aLMC is just going by the details provided by the tax payers, and possibility of fraud and misrepresentation of facts is quite high; LMC may be also suffering a loss,a said a Samajwadi Party corporator while talking to TNN. Moreover, a minister recently ordered that no tax surveyor would enter the house for measurements as it would intrude upon the occupants' privacy.The corporators feel that reduction in slabs, would not augment the revenue collection. aOnly an end to their lop sided attitude would increase its revenue,a they added.Infrastructure Professionals Enterprise (IPE), a Delhi-based company hired for the geographical information survey (GIS), has also come under severe criticism. IPE is creating a database of Lucknow to ensure that no house owner can dodge the tax collector. aThe company has been working on the project for the past four years; but no results can be seen. Moreover, it has done the survey in only few wards so far,a alleged one of the corporators.	1

"NEW DELHI: The Congress'' dynastic politics has taken a fresh turn with the fourth generation Nehru-Gandhi offspring making yet another foray into the political arena without getting formally anointed by the family or the party leadership.Non-political persons or those without political aspirations do not hold meetings with block presidents of a political party or urge the party''s youth wing to rebuild houses damaged in fire.But that is what Priyanka did during in her visit to Amethi last week.In fact, voters in Congress president Sonia Gandhi''s constituency had openly asked Priyanka this time to be their representative in the next general elections. And she did not commit that she would not replace her mother, but merely said she would decide later.But neither the mother nor the party leadership has come out openly in support of her political actions. Priyanka has no official position in the party yet, leading to speculation that she may not be the chosen successor to Sonia Gandhi.Congress leaders here see a parallel between the leadership''s silence on her activities and the party''s attitude towards Sonia Gandhi when she first tested waters in 1995.""Between August 1995 and December 1997, when Sonia announced that she would campaign for the party, the leadership was ambiguous about its treatment of Gandhi. The same amount of ambiguity prevails now over Priyanka''s status in the party,"" said a Congress insider.Congress leaders point out that the AICC or Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh Motilal Vora is hardly ever involved in Priyanka''s visits to Amethi and neighbouring constituencies. While UP leaders keep clamouring for Priyanka, the AICC leadership has never made any such demand to utilise Priyanka''s services in the party.Congress politics revolves around the Gandhi family and hence the succession pattern is of utmost importance to the leaders. In fact, the career of many leaders depends on whether the son (Rahul Gandhi) or the daughter is anointed by the mother. While Priyanka has been making highly publicised visits to Amethi, her brother has not cut teeth in politics yet.But the very fact that high profile leaders are not willing to risk their careers by pitching for Priyanka is seen as a clear indication that her political entry is yet to be sorted out within the family. ""Her aggressive style of functioning may not be acceptable to many of the leaders. But the cadre that believes in the magic of the Nehru-Gandhi legacy is sure that she could work wonders for the party,"" said a Congress leader."	0
SURAT: Following an application moved by Sunanda Shetty's counsel Kalpesh Desai, the hearing on her bail plea application in the Prafful Sarees extortion case was postponed by the chief judicial magistrate to Friday from Monday.Desai later told TNN that Sunanda was unable to be present in court on medical grounds and other unavoidable circumstances.The hearing on the regular bail plea application of Surendra Shetty, who is presently in judicial custody here, will be held in the district and sessions court here on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Mumbai hotelier Padmanabhan Kotian held in the same case was remanded in judicial custody till July 13 by a local court on Monday. As Surat police did not seek his police remand, chief judicial magistrate R Mehta remanded him in judicial custody.Kotian's lawyer Jayesh Thakaria filed a petition urging bail for his client on the ground that police had already interrogated him in custody and that he had cooperated with investigators.	0
AHMEDABAD: In a surprise move, the state government on Wednesday invoked the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) on 131 accused, including three minor boys and eight persons who have already been let off for alack of evidencea, in the Godhra carnage case.Police moved the sessions court in this regard a week before the first anniversary of the ghastly attack in which 59 people were burnt alive in the S-6 coach of the Sabarmati Express at Godhra, resulting in the deadly retaliatory attacks all over Gujarat.This is the second time the government has invoked Pota in the Godhra case, having withdrawn its earlier move last year under pressure. The move comes close on the heels of the Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by deputy inspector general Rakesh Asthana, getting its prize catch, cleric Maulana Hussain Umarji, after which they claimed to have come close to establishing the conspiracy behind the February 27 attack.The SIT is also contemplating putting Umarji through the polygraph test soon. Interestingly, the Pota move coincided with the date of hearing of six of the accused for bail at the Gujarat High Court on Wednesday. Sources in the government told TNN that although athe government was mulling over the application of this law, it was expedited on account of the likelihood of more accused being bailed outa.Apparently, the recent release of two accused had left the authorities anguished. Former Godhra municipality president Mohammad Husain Kalota, against whom the SIT has not yet found any convincing evidence, too has been roped into this list. Of the eight already released under Section 169 of the CrPC for lack of evidence, two are members of the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi) and two Kashmiris associated with an accused, Nanu Miyan.The four others are drug peddlers who were taken on transfer warrants for questioning. The state government had invoked Pota soon after the attack on the train when it was merely an ordinance awaiting promulgation as a law. The appeal filed by the police for invoking Pota states that the torching of the S-6 compartment was pre-meditated and that Umarji was the prime conspirator and financier for the perpetrators of the act. Additional director general of the CID (Crime) AK Bhargava said that athe appeal filed in the courts for invoking Pota was for 65 accused who were in judicial custody, seven of whom were bailed out, eight who were released under Section 169 of the CrPC for lack of evidence, 51 absconders and 20-25 persons of the core group of which 12 are arrested.aA search is on for Salim Haji Panwala, who apparently provoked the mob and kept a tab on the timing of the Sabarmati Express that day.The application seeks to book them under Section 3 of the law. Legal eagles have criticised the move on the ground that ait is arbitrarya. aIt came when the investigations were almost complete,a a senior lawyer said.	1

"MUMBAI: As the US troops get ready for a long-drawn battle in the Iraqi desert, the Indian IT sector is bracing itself for bad news. A prolonged war would affect business decisions and companies are apprehensive that the nervousness will hit them hard. Many are already seeing a drop in client visits. ""If this war is prolongeda""and that seems likelya""it will certainly dampen travel enthusiasm.More importantly, it will slow down all investment decisions,"" said Zensar Technologies MD Ganesh Natarajan.Industry sources said that clients in the US and UK are showing tremendous nervousness about travel to and from the US as well as within the European Union. Officials of many companies are cancelling their visits to the sub-continent. Enterasys Networks V-P Bob Ray, who was scheduled to visit India next week, cancelled his trip ""because of certain flight and travel restrictions"".Gartner's country manager Sujay Chohan said, ""Client visits have definitely slowed down. Many companies have also admitted that many of their customers are postponing their visits to the country. In the long-term, clients will have to re-evaluate their strategies for offshoring.""Analysts indicate that business sentiments will definitely be affected. If patriotic sentiments are fuelled in the US, then American companies would retreat and offshore business would be hit, they said.""A long conflict will have an impacta""because of travel restrictions and the economic fallout. Should the war drag on for months, the global economy will be hit, and consequently, so will the IT industrya""since travel, investment decisions and technology spending will be put on hold,"" admitted Nasscom president Kiran Karnik.The industry had anticipated a short war and was hopeful that the conflict would actually fuel the outsourcing wave, as US companies would look for opportunities to save costs. Karnik is, however, hopeful that once the war is over, business will return to normal. ""War also reinforces the need for Indian firms to have business continuity and disaster-recovery plans in place and the need for them to highlight their global delivery models to their potential clients,"" he added.Some companies, like Tata Consultancy Services, said clients are taking a wait-and-watch approach. ""Work on ongoing projects is continuing as usual. In fact, one of our clients from Germany visited us last week. But most of the clients are watching the situation,"" a TCS spokesperson said."	1
LUCKNOW: The big news is that it''s all peaceful here all too suddenly. Chief Minister Mayawati and her mentor, Kansiram, have been away in Mumbai effectively to extend the influence of their party beyond the borders of Uttar Pradesh, while Mulayam Singh Yadav and his lieutenants were busy holding the special session of their party''s national executive in Agra.And former prime minister Chandrashekhar was seen rubbing shoulders with Nanaji Deshmukh at Chitrakoot where the former inaugurated a concrete road built out of the latter''s MP fund on Sunday.Indeed, there are reasons why the guns have fallen silent. First, it''s holi time. Second, all major political players think it wise to keep themselves engaged in the waiting game till the ''truth'' is unearthed through the rather slow, painstaking excavation process at Ayodhya. And third, believe it or not, they are all silently preparing for a snap Lok Sabha elections. The current view in Opposition circles is that both the Sangh Parivar and the Vajpayee government are working in tandem to recreate a pro-temple wave in the country. If something is found deep under the surface at Ayodhya, the VHP''s temple movement will get a big boost. And even if nothing big is found therein by October this year, the Union government has in any case moved the Supreme Court to get the stay order on the ''undisputed'' part of the land vacated. In the meantime, the VHP is preparing for its Delhi ''satyagraha'' on March 27.Ironically, the BJP also views the overall political scenario from the same angle. Party leaders don''t say so in as many words but they do put it on record that they have to be prepared to face the electorate all the time. At the moment, their honeymoon with the BSP continues, giving them the hope for a Dalit-upper caste consolidation in their favour. Should their tie-up with the BSP come to an abrupt end, the proposed Ram wave would carry them through, the BJP leaders feel.But Mulayam Singh Yadav is a past-master at gauging the winds beforehand. He has anticipated that his main rival next time would be the BJP and not the BSP, unlike the previous Assembly elections when the BJP was relegated to the third spot. Little wonder then that the Samajwadi Party chief trained his guns mainly on the BJP during the special session of his party''s national executive at Agra.He said that it was because of the BJP that the nation in general and the state in particular had come to such a sorry pass. It was time the BJP was thrown out of power from Delhi to Lucknow, he added.The BSP is no less alert. It is keeping its options open vis-a-vis the BJP. Little wonder then that the party supremo Kansiram appealed to the Dalits in Maharashtra to accept Buddhism as their religion just like Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar had done decades ago. On her part, Mayawati has already stepped up her anti-Manuwadi tirade.	0
LUCKNOW: Amidst fear of violence, the opposition will have three opportunities to test the majority of the BJP-BSP coalition government, led by chief minister Mayawati, during the brief budget session, beginning February 28.Sensing trouble during the budget session, Mayawati dashed to speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi's residence to discuss the security arrangements in view of the leader of the opposition Mohammed Azam Khan's apprehending violence.Both were closeted for over an hour.aThe CM regretted Khan's statement and has expressed concern over security. She has requested the speaker for elaborate security arrangements for the budget session,a stated BJPLP leader Lalji Tandon adding that the ruling alliance was considering to move a privilege motion against the 'undemocratic' and 'irresponsible' statement of the leader of opposition in UP assembly.The UP assembly has a violent history. About 33 MLAs, including former speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi, had sustained injuries when members from the treasury and the opposition benches took to fisticuffs on December 16, 1993. Blood stained the floor of the august house again on October 21, 1997, when about 50 members were injured, many seriously, with mikes being used as missiles freely by unruly members. The day is still remembered as the 'black day' in the history of the state legislature.The opposition is all set to have three opportunities to test the majority of the coalition government when the latter faces two money bills and the motion of thanks on the governor's address. The fourth opportunity may also come the opposition way if the business advisory committee approves the SP-Congress notices against the speaker. The budget session will begin with the Governor addressing the joint session of the state legislature on the opening day on February 28. Condolence messages will be taken up on March 3 followed by the supplementary budget the next day. March 5 is the most crucial day for the Mayawati government when it faces the first trial of strength during voting on the supplementary budget.If the government manages to defeat the joint opposition, it may be a smooth sailing for the coalition government the next two days when the interim budget/ vote on account for about five months and the motion of thanks are placed before the House. In the past, the CB Gupta and Charan Singh governments had fallen during the motion of thanks. If notices against the speaker are taken up for division, Tripathi will be the sixth speaker of the UP assembly to have faced impeachment. However, it was only Dhani Ram Varma who was removed from the coveted chair by 279-0 votes on June 20, 1995. Notices against others, including Pushottam Das Tandon, Atma Ram Kher, Madan Mohan Varma and Vasudeo Singh were withdrawn either after or without holding any debate.	1

MUMBAI: Bowing to popular wishes, the state government has decided to reconsider its decision to scrap the proposal for a Shivaji memorial in Mumbai's suburb. Minister of state for general administration Vijaykumar Gavit came under fire from both ruling parties and the opposition in the legislative council on Thursday when he told the house that the proposal had been dropped. Nationalist Congress party (NCP) member Vinayak Mete led the attack. He was supported by Sudha Joshi (Congress) and nominated member Jogendra Kawade.	1
LUCKNOW: About 55 kilometres from the Ambedkar Memorial in the state capital is village Katka Khurd in Sandila Tehsil of Hardoi. The hamlet is a stark example of how life of the poor belies the tall claims made by the government regarding uplift of the suppressed people. In this village, bonded labour is still prevalent. Locked up in dingy rooms for decades, whipped for small errors, starved as a punishment for spoiling a stack of hay and strictly prohibited to talk to fellow bonded labourers.One such labourer sneaked out of captivity. Still shivering from the decade-long nightmare, he is yet to get used to the hustle and bustle of city life. Talking in murmurs to this correspondent, he identified himself as Grijraj of Bharatapur village in Kannauj. Deserted by his starving parents over a decade ago (he has lost track of time but insists that his now bushy beard and moustaches had not come up then), Grijraj reached Charbagh where, after a few days of begging, he met a man promising a job at a cloth store for Rs 1,000 per month. Once at Katka Khurd village, he was held captive. Made to do all menial errands at the farm, Gajraj was given very little to eat the whole day. After sunset, henchmen of his masters, village pradhan Deshraj Singh and his brother Rajjan Singh, would lock up Grijraj in a small store. Released before daybreak, he was again escorted to fields under a watch. Deprived of the next meal if found resting at work, Grijraj developed a patch of hard thick skin on the head with no hair growth because of regularly lifting loads. Asked about his earning in captivity, Grijraj insisted he was not given any. They were prohibited from venturing out of the farm and could not interact with ten other fellow labourers still in captivity.Grijraj recently managed to sneak out of the confinement and was spotted by a local villager who is a student. A native of Katka Khurd, this youth was aware of what all happened within the fiefdom of Dashraj and Rajjan Singh. He brought Grijraj to the state capital. Fighting for the rights of bonded labourers, this student approached the People's Union for Human Rights (PUHR) and even sent a letter to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). But efforts appeared to be rather costly as he was forced into hiding allegedly after henchmen of the Singh brothers struck at his native house.Portraying the agony of some 10 bonded labourers who are still in captivity of the Singh brothers, Grijraj narrated spine-chilling happenings there. A labourer fell ill and died. Being from a lower caste, none touched his body. The body was tied to a bull which dragged it to the river Gomati near the 1440-strong populated village. In deep waters, the rope was cut as the bull swam across to safety and the body was washed away by strong water currents.The amount of political clout and help from the local police and the administration to the Singhs was a testimony to the fact that despite being fully aware of bonded labourers in Katka Khurd village, none could dare object to the inhuman act. And Babloo, who did attempt, is paying for his courage. He may have rescued Grijraj from bondage, but now he himself is underground. The masters of Grijraj and his musclemen are on his trail.	1
HYDERABAD: Hundreds of MCH bill collectors thronged the MCH head office on Friday and protested against senior officials for not reacting immediately to the complaint by a Circle VI bill collector Rajeswar Rao. They alleged that Rajeswar Rao was manhandled by a Chirag Ali Lane resident Shoukath Ali when he went to give a demand notice to him for payment of property tax.According to an official, Shoukath Ali abused the bill collector and dared the bill collector to force him pay the property tax.When the bill collector went ahead and gave him the demand notice for the payment of property tax, Shoukath Ali beat up the bill collector.Later when the bill collector informed the incident to MCH deputy commissioner Srinivas Rao, the officer did not act immediately, the official alleged. However, after many bill collectors put pressure on him, a complaint was lodged later at the Abids police station. The police arrested Shoukath Ali after Srinivas Rao asked his valuation officer to file an FIR.The bill collectors demanded that security cover should be provided to them as they often face such threats. They also demanded action against the officers for not acting promptly even when their own staff was beaten up for doing his job.Mayor Teegala Krishna Reddy intervened and assured the protesters that all their problems will be sorted out. He also said that he would take action if any official was found negligent of their duty.	1
MUMBAI: Experts from the state forensic laboratory, Kalina, who examined the site of the two bomb blasts at Vile Parle, say the explosive in both cases was ammonium nitrate, a chemical that is used in fertiliser and is available freely.aThe detonation was initiated by a mixture of sulphuric acid, sugar and potassium chloride,'' Rukmini Krishnamurthy, director of the state forensic lab, told TNN on Wednesday.These chemicals, too, are easily available in the market.Tremendous heat is produced when the acid is poured on a mixture of sugar and potassium chloride and the heat sets off the explosion in ammonium nitrate.This was the same material used for the bomb which went off in the World Trade Center, New York, before the 1993 serial blasts of Mumbai. According to Ms Krishnamurthy, the bomb can be timed to go off at a particular hour by controlling the release of acid. aThe acid is kept in a balloon and it falls on the explosive powder drop by drop as it eats away the rubber,'' she explained. The forensic expert said the first bomb was placed in a bag of wheat and tied to a cycle.aApart from the nails used as shrapnel, grains of wheat were extracted from the bodies of victims,'' Ms Krishnamurthy said.The second bomb, too, was tied to a cycle in an adjoining lane but it was kept in a bag of jowar. The police had detected this bomb but it went off even as they were preparing to defuse it. The second explosion left a crater in the road. Anywhere between two to three kg of ammonium nitrate could have been used in each of the blasts, the expert estimated.According to Ms Krishnamurthy, who has been examining bomb sites for the last 25 years, saboteurs and terrorists are getting better at devising the timer mechanism.In the December 2 Ghatkopar blast too ammonium nitrate was used, while gelatin sticks were used in the bomb found at Seepz, Marol, the same day. In the blast at Mumbai Central station on December 6, the explosive used was gunpowder. It was made of potassium nitrate, sulphur and charcoal.aAll the items can be procured easily,'' said Ms Krishnamurthy. The bicycle in the first blast was completely mangled but the second one is providing vital clues to the police. Investigators are now questioning cycle shop owners in the nearby localities to identify the bicycle which has a picture of a cockroach on its rear mudguard.Sources said, the bicycles were old and freshly painted. Both were double-barred and are the type used by vegetable vendors. Both were locked and left unattended.	1
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Close on the heels of reports of two suspected SARS cases from Kerala, an equal number of unconfirmed anthrax cases have been reported from the state, an official release said here on Friday.The release said two persons hailing from Panachikad in Kottayam district were admitted to Kottayam Medical College hospital with suspected symptoms of anthrax infection.An expert medical team would examine and study the disease and strengthen preventive measures, the release said.Meanwhile, the state government has stepped up its preventive measures against SARS in the wake of two persons with suspected SARS symptoms being admitted for observation at a hospital here and at Kochi.	0

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to 33 persons including Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani and HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi on a petition seeking review of its order allowing transfer of their trial in the Ayodhya demolition case from Lucknow to a Rae Bareilly court.

NEW DELHI: With the arrest of a priest along with six girls and a man, police on Friday claimed to have busted a prostitution racket in Noida on the outskirts of Delhi allegedly being run by a cleric.Based on an information, a house in Noida was raided this afternoon and six girls and the kingpin Shiva Dwivedi were arrested, Noida Superintendent of Police (City) Vijay Bhushan Singh said.The racket was allegedly being operated from the house taken on rent of Rs 20,000, he said, adding the clients were contacted over telephone.The girls, aged between 18 and 22, hail from well to do families like those of businessmen, Singh said.Dwivedi, who originally hails from Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh, acts as a priest at a temple in Khanpur in South Delhi as a cover apparently to avoid detection, he said.One Sanjay, who allegedly used to work as a pimp, was also nabbed, the SP said.	0
LUCKNOW: Killing of a forest guard, seventh in the last six years in the Chandraprabha wildlife sanctuary, in Chandauli district on Saturday has agitated state foresters. Irate forest guards in the area have ainformally expressed their helplessnessa in manning the jungles any longer until their safety is guaranteed by the government. According to reliable sources, local foresters of Kashi range have sent an SOS to the forest top brass seeking their intervention in the wake of alowering staff morale and seething angera on the killing of their colleague at the hands of alleged Naxalites.An official said that top officials in the government including the chief secretary and principal secretary (home) and forests had been apprised of the fallout of the killing. Forest guard Amresh Singh was kidnapped on January 16 and a ransom of Rs three lakh was demanded, in addition to a rifle and 60 bullets. Later, it was also demanded in writing from the DFO Kashi range, that all forest land in the wildlife sanctuary be given to local farmers for cultivation. However, combing operations by armed wildlife guards and police teams culminated in the discovery of Singh's corpse on January 25 in the thickets. His neck was slit and eyes gouged out by alleged MCC activists. Principal chief conservator forests (PCCF) RL Singh while confirming the incident pointed out that as many as three ranges of the sanctuary namely Jai Mohani, Majgayi and Naugarh were already under Naxalite occupation. The death of Singh comes after similar murders at the hands of alleged Naxals came to light. Manna Yadav was murdered in 1996, Musafir Choubey and Gorakhnath Yadav in 1999, Chandrama Yadava in 2000 and Kamlesh Yadav and Khushiram Dubey in 2001. According to reports, the PCCF who went to the site of the incident on January 18 was acommunicated the feeling of insecurity amongst the staff manning the areaa. Singh while pointing out that incidents like this were aoccupational hazardsa said that more steps were required to areassure the committed staffa. A senior official told this newspaper that the top forest brass were mulling over a proposal where it would aforward a long standing demand of change in service rulesa which would fill many lacunae in the existing set-up. It is reliably learnt that foresters are also pressing for a constitution of medals and awards like the 'Ashok Chakra' and 'Veer Chakra' posthumously for foresters who are killed during duty.A representation to the same effect is being sent to the Indian Board for Wildlife headed by Prime minister Vajpayee, a source said. Foresters numbering 158 of different ranks have been killed on duty since 1978 in the state.	1

HYDERABAD: The two sisters who are recovering at the Osmania General Hospital (OGH) after a suicide bid at High Court complex on Wednesday are contemplating another suicide attempt, once they are discharged. aWe have been let down by everyone. We do not want to live anymore. We are going to hurl ourselves under a moving train this time,a a frustrated Feroz Begum and Firdouse Begum told The Times of India on Thursday.The two sisters along with the two daughters of Feroz, consumed sleeping pills at the High Court canteen on Wednesday. Feroz Begum's husband Syed Bin Abdullah, a rowdy sheeter in Mahabubnagar, was killed by rivals about six years ago. After the incident, Feroz Begum moved in with her eldest sister, Siddiqui Begum's house at Mehdipatnam. Siddiqui took about Rs 3 lakh from Feroz on some pretext and did not pay back the money. Feroz Begum's land was also encroached upon by her in-laws. When she wanted to fight a legal battle with her in-laws, Siddiqui introduced Feroz to Mannan who claimed to be a legal expert. But Mannan robbed Feroz of her jewellery and the little money she had. In the meantime, Firdouse, deserted by her husband Tanweer Ahmed also moved to Siddiqui's apartment. Firdouse who worked as a beautician in Dubai, returned recently within a couple of months following physical abuse. The duo worked as junior artistes in film industry and the wages they earned were given to Siddiqui, the two sisters said. aHowever, Siddiqui was not content with it and wanted to make easy money by forcing us into prostitution. We were thrown out of the house when we refuseda, Feroz and Firdouse said. aSiddiqui continued to pressurise us even after we were thrown,athey said. Meanwhile, the Charminar police said nobody has been arrested in the case.	1
ARA: In protest against, what she alleged, the arbitrary style of Shahpur BDO''s functioning and his prejudiced attitude, the block pramukh, Munni Devi, sat on fast-unto-death on the block premises at Shahpur on Tuesday.Her deputy Ramdeo Singh, panchayat samiti members Kripan Devi, Maya Devi, Shila Devi, Babban Tiwary, Nandjee Roy, Vishnu Roy, R S Yadav, Ramakant Ojha, R B Pandey, Raj Kumar Singh, Sushil Ojha and Ghanshyam Pandey also sat on the dharna to express their solidarity.Speaking to mediapersons, Munni Devi alleged corruption in the block office at Shahpur.

She further alleged that the BDO was giving orders illegally to get administrative approval for making plans and estimates of several schemes without any recommendation.However, the Shahpur BDO, Bijay Kumar Upadhyay, when contacted, refuted the pramukh''s allegations and said that her supporters were putting undue pressure on the junior engineer concerned to make false entry into the measurement book. He disclosed that the pramukh had asked to give works of different schemes in an undemocratic way to her supporters. He also alleged that the pramukh was taking bribe from the beneficiaries of the Indira Awas Yojana.

NEW DELHI: Afghan President Hamid Karzai arrived here on Wednesday for talks with the Indian leadership ahead of a crucial UN resolution on Iraq.The Afghan president has been trying to mobilise international opinion over concerns that an attack on Iraq would divert attention from Afghanistan.Karzai was expected to be here last week, but the visit was rescheduled after bad weather delayed his departure from the US.Karzai will now arrive in India from Qatar where he is attending the extraordinary meeting of the OIC.Germany, which is now heading ISAF along with Netherlands, had hinted at the possibility of troop withdrawal from Afghanistan recently, but the German president Johannes Rau affirmed Germany''s commitment to security in Afghanistan during his ongoing visit to India.Afghanistan was today handed over a fleet of buses and the third and last airbus will be handed over in a ceremony on Saturday. The two countries will also sign a preferential trade agreement during the visit.Karzai may also use the occasion to seek a greater involvement of India in the security regime under construction in Iraq. India has so far been concentrating on relief and rehabilitation measures and has stayed on the fringes of support for Afghanistan''s security requirements not least because of Pakistani concerns.	1
"SINGAPORE: As the Ayodhya issue hot up, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Tuesday said the problem has to be resolved either through a dialogue between parties or a court order.""The government is of the view that this is a matter which needs to be resolved, either by mutual talks or a court order,"" Advani, who is on a three-day visit here, said while replying to a question after delivering a lecture on Security and Development organised by the Institute of South East Asian Studies.His remarks assume significance in the light of VHP''s demand that the government hand over land in Ayodhya to it for temple construction by this month end.Describing communal violence in Gujarat as a ""strong reaction"" to the Godhra carnage, Advani said BJP''s landslide victory in the state assembly elections was a result of the ""campaign of calumny"" unleashed against it by the opposition.""The state government suppressed these riots using force ... about 200 persons were killed in police firing. This fact was disregarded ... and a campaign of calumny was unleashed against the government of the state,"" he said when asked whether Godhra and its aftermath pointed towards the emergence of Hindu extremism and whether India would become ""less secular""."	1
"MUMBAI: For the four-member ''sitting squad'' of the Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, the Class X and XII examinations are as taxing as they are for the students.While their counterparts in the ''flying squads'' pay surprise visits to exam centres, the ''sitting squad'' takes its job literallya""its members spend time during the exams sitting in the classrooms, eyes wide open for any malpractices that might occur.aThey actually sit through the three hours of the exam, usually in schools from where we get regular complaints of cheating,'''' says board chairperson J M Abhyankar.The sitting squad, which made its appearance this year, is the board''s latest attempt to check copying. It has introduced a system of masking the roll numbers so that examiners cannot identify students and has set up 13 flying squads to conduct surprise raids on schools. The board has also appealed to principals and teachers to keep a strict vigil during the exams.However, its efforts are still to deter many students eager to clear the board exams, no matter what the cost. Since the Higher Secondary Certificate examinations started on February 21, the board has so far caught more than 50 students copying from others and smuggling notes and guides inside the exam hall.Board officials say the supervising teachers are also responsible for students indulging in cheating.They have the names of 15-odd teachers, suspected to have connived with the students, who were caught red-handed this time around.aWhen students are found with chits or notes, it means that teachers are not checking them,'''' explains a board official. And if many students in the same hall carry notes, it raises questions about the teacher''s role, he says.The board will conduct an inquiry into the cases of cheating before deciding on any punishment. This could include cancelling students'' results and debarring them from appearing for the board exam for the next few years."	0
VADODARA: Non-resident Indian Pragnesh Desai and his friend Vipul Patel from Vadodara, arrested in connection with the murder of US model Leona Swinderski by the Thane police, have been remanded to judicial custody till March 8, police sources said.The two had been remanded to judicial custody for 12 days on February 24 by a Thane court.Patel and Desai were arrested after Leona''s body was found from Mumbai-Thane road last month, and it was later found that she had been strangulated to death.Desai, after divorcing his wife in the US, had wanted to marry the model, but changed his plans claiming that she had planned to kill his former wife and children.Desai allegedly hired two professional killers from Surat to kidnap the model and kill her. He had also discussed his plan with his friend Patel who helped him in his plans.The Thane police had recovered $21,300, Indian currency and a bag belonging to the American model from Patel''s house in Karelibaug. Desai owns two restaurants in the US and is a partner in two big stores. He left Vadodara about 19 years ago.	1
"HUBLI: Ever since satellite and cable television technology came of age, cinema theatres in the region have ceased to be good business proposition. A total of around 30 cinema theatres in Dharwad, Belgaum, Haveri and Gadag districts are either lying idle or have been demolished or converted into marriage choultries and office premises, while a majority of them are running under huge losses. Sangeeth theatre in Hubli, which used to be the favourite haunt for Hindi and Kannada filmgoers not long ago, has been converted into a choultry now. A few owners are now contemplating demolishing the premises apparently to explore the possibility of erecting a commercial complex. The owners of Shanthi Venkatesh talkies in Gadag may soon think of this venture, sources said.The poor financial viability of two reputed theatres at Belgaum, which used to screen Hindi movies and occasionally English, has now compelled the owners to convert the premises into a marriage choultry. Though a question mark hangs over the future of a number of other theaters, they have been refurbished and thrown open to film-lovers after renovation and new digital accessories. Quite a few cinemas in the Hubli-Dharwad are reported to be incurring losses due to various reasons, including poor turnout of cine-goers. Cinema owners confess that many theatre establishments in the twin cities were facing the threat of closure. Prakash, manager of Sri Padma theatre said his business was not a viable proposition anymore. Running a film theatre entailed a huge investment. The returns did not commensurate with the investment and the running expenditure, he said. ""Why will the people go to cinemas when they can get to watch the latest movies on television in the comfort of their homes?"" he asked. As if the telecast of movies by television channels, albeit after obtaining the rights, was not enough, many local cable TV operators were illegally beaming the latest movies into the homes. ""All they have to do is just play a VCD and relay it to the homes of their subscribers,"" another cinema owner lamented. The relaying of movies through cable television by local operators was illegal. However, the authorities had not been able to implement the provision of Cinematography and Cable TV Act to check such illegal telecast of movies. ""Obtaining the rights of telecast was essential for showing movies on television"", pointed out some dejected theatre owners. ""We have urged the authorities to crack down on such illegal telecast of movies by invoking the provisions of the Act. The making of poor quality films, especially in Kannada has been contributing to poor turnout of film-goers, Arun, manager of Lakshminarayana theatre contended.The state government''s recent decisions to levy tax on remade Kannada films was another big blow, he added.The deplorable condition of cinemas is another factor keeping people away from cinemas. Some cinema lovers admitted that a few cinemas claimed to have sophisticated sound system, but did not provide the audience with the facility. Also, the condition of seats in most theatres was far from satisfactory. A few cinema owners are of the opinion that people will start watching films in cinemas if the managements maintain the premises well and provide hi-tech sound systems.As if all this was not enough. The Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce has issued a fresh circular insisting on the cinema exhibitors to share service tax and cinema hall rentals with producers. ""This is sure to spell the final death-knell for movie theatre owners here"", said R.S. Patil, President of Karnataka Film Exhibitors association."	0
NEW DELHI: The battle between the two factions of the Samata Party owing allegiance to defence minister George Fernandes and railway minister Nitish Kumar took a new turn on Friday, when Fernandes'' associate and party MP Raghunath Jha bowed to pressure from rebel MPs owing allegiance to Nitish and resigned as president of the Bihar unit, party sources said.Jha reportedly submitted his resignation to Fernandes on Thursday night. Sources said the rebel MPs, who were planning to hold the state executive meeting in Patna on January 19, may now drop their plan in view of Jha''s resignation.Earlier, the MPs had threatened to split the party by not renewing their membership if Jha was not removed from his post immediately.Meanwhile, the Samata Parliamentary Party, at its three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Friday, appointed Vashishth Narain Singh as its interim convener, sources said.	1
"PATNA: Bihar is passing through politics of ""mobile phones and their printouts"". In the dock is Union minister Dr C P Thakur. Laloo Yadav on Wednesday waved before journalists the printout of a call made by the abductors of Dr Ramesh Chandra to the residence of Dr Thakur as ultimate proof of Thakur's nexus with the kidnappers' gang. Thakur defends himself saying ""the phone is kept downstairs where a large number of people, including some from my constituency, reside"".He was not in Patna when the phone call was made. But the ""alibi"" appears to be unacceptable to Laloo. ""The owner should know who lives in his house and who uses the phone,"" remarked the RJD chief. Ironically, around five years ago, when Thakur was charged with snatching ballot papers at a booth in Kankarbagh, it were the telephone printouts which came to his help. The booth had been looted by his opponents and Thakur, through his mobile phone, repeatedly contacted the Patna DM giving information about booth-capturing. When charges were levelled against him about looting ballot papers at the booth, the phone printouts of his calls to Patna DM came handy as proof of his innocence. ""If the printouts of telephones at the CM's residence is taken, it would make startling revelations. It would reveal that 1, Anne Marg had received phone calls from many legislators like Surendra Yadav and Azad Gandhi, who are absconding,"" stated leader of the opposition, Sushil Kumar Modi. He insisted that printouts did not reveal the nature of talks. Incidentally, BSNL appears to be under pressure. Laloo threatened to take action against BSNL because, he alleged, one page of the printouts of phone calls was torn. ""We will not spare even the BSNL employees,"" he remarked. Crime and politics in Bihar have gone hi-tech with mobile phones. Beur central jail, where several legislators are lodged, has been repeatedly said to be the epicentre of crime."	0
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has issued a show cause notice to the Union of India and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) over a petition filed by the employees of ICMR seeking a salary hike.The hike in pay is in keeping with the recommendations made by the fifth pay commission. The notices were collected by counsels for government and ICMR Meera Bhatia and Sikri and Company respectively.The commission had recommended a pay scale of of Rs 1640-2900 in place of Rs 425-700 for research assistants with post graduate qualifications which ICMR had failed to implement.They had, instead offered a pay scale of Rs 1400-2300. The employees had then approached the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) which initially upheld the recommendations of the pay commission, but later backtracked after the intervention of the Union government and modified the order. The petitioners said the government and ICMR had arbitrarily rejected the salary hike recommended by the pay commission. The government and ICMR will have to file their replies before July 25.	0
"NEW DELHI: The Vajpayee government is officially committed to identifying and sending back some 15 million Bangladeshis thought to be staying illegally in India. Since most of these people have been staying for long in India and are engaged in various economic activities, the economic impact of their deportation is unlikely to be positive. The government is yet to make estimations of the economic fallout since data on the employment and other economic profiles of these so-called illegal migrants are hard to get.Most Bangladeshi migrants are, however, believed to be engaged in the informal sector of services domestic help, in Delhi, for example and petty trade. In the agricultural sector, they form a significant part of the farm labour force in select pockets of India. For political reasons, the government seems insistent on looking at these Bangladeshis as ""infiltrators"" rather than ""economic migrants"", trying to deport them en masse. But given the reality of labour flows the world over, this is likely to be a Sisyphean task. The fact is that as long as there are relatively better economic opportunities in India and the demand for cheap labour by Indian households and employers, economic migration from Bangladesh cannot be checked. Economists believe that the policy to send back migrants en masse would also adversely impact the prospects for regional economic integration. This may put paid to any concept of creating a regional common market or a free trade zone, which presupposes not only free movement of goods across borders but also of factors of production including people. Political difficulties with Pakistan have put the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) in limbo and the government's policy towards Dhaka is likely to kill the ambitious BIMSTEC (Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation) initiative. Analysts cite the India-Nepal arrangement under which citizens of the two countries freely move across the border. Economic opportunities in India have attracted a large number of Nepalese to live and work in this country and that has not necessarily been a ""problem"". There have been security issues concerning the open Indo-Nepal border -- a plane hijacking, counterfeiting of currency, ISI activities, even violence by Nepalese domestics -- but no one has made a case for shutting the border. Despite the pressure, the Indo-Nepal border has been kept open for decades and all that is needed now is that people crossing the Indo-Nepal border should possess some authentic form of identification. As long as people find better economic opportunities, they would move across the long and porous borders in South Asia. One batch of these economic migrants, when deported, would be replaced by another batch since the demand for their labour would remain. Managing economic migrants though a system of registration and work permits may be a better alternative, according to some analysts. International debates at the UN, ILO and other fora have stressed that there are three aspects of illegal migration. They concern the unlawful migrant's status as a violator of immigration laws, as a worker, and as a human being. ""The conclusion has been that each of these situations has its own legal consequences which should not be confused to the detriment of the individual worker's rights"", the UN has noted."	1
KOLKATA: At least half-adozen people took loans amounting to Rs 15 lakh over the past one year from an Allahabad Bank branch posing as teachers of a south Kolkata school that did not exist.

"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala government''s Global Investor Meet (GIM) beginning at Kochi on Saturday is the first-ever conscious attempt by the state, with issue-based support from the Opposition, to showcase its core strengths to potential business players with a view to attracting the much-needed investment for economic growth. Unlike in the past when political parties used to cross swords even on development issues, the main opposition LDF led by the CPI-M had offered co-operation for the conduct of GIM while insisting that projects should be transparent and should not harm the interests of the common man.The government, on its part, had spared no effort to win the confidence of the opposition by convening an all-party meeting well ahead of GIM where it succeeded in getting the ""go-ahead"" from them. ""Infinity in a nutshell"" is the catchword for GIM, which is to witness the convergence of an array of global businessmen in the state''s commercial capital. Already rated as one of the ten tourist destinations in the world, the ""God''s own country"" is now focussing its attention on the hitherto-neglected area of industrial investment.The cash-strapped Kerala seeks to utilise GIM to present before the investor the ""infinite"" investment opportunities in the fields of tourism, information technology, agro and food processing, infrastructure, bio-technology, urban development and real estate."	1
"NEW DELHI: The BJP''s central office-bearers and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani will meet at party president Venkaiah Naidu''s residence on Wednesday morning to discuss two key issues. Party sources said on Tuesday that they will discuss whether the government should consider advancing the parliamentary polls, holding them by the end of the year, if the BJP performs well in the coming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh and Delhi, all currently held by the Congress. The feeling in the party is that the Vajpayee government has completed five years in power, starting with his 1998 stint, and it would be better to strike sooner rather than later. The second issue concerns the fate of Union rural development minister Shanta Kumar. The sources said that while the PM is inclined to retain him in his cabinet, Advani and Naidu want him to be dropped because of the latter''s remarks about former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal who led the BJP to a defeat in that state recently. After the results came in, Kumar had said that the BJP in that state had failed to fulfil the ""promises"" it had made to the people. With Advani and Naidu convinced that the differences between Kumar and Dhumal had caused the debacle, this remark was not taken kindly. Moreover, Kumar had been one of the few people in the party to openly criticise Gujarat CM Narendra Modi in the wake of the communal violence in that state. If Advani and Naidu, who are not satisfied with Kumar''s explanation about his remarks, succeed in convincing the PM that he should be dropped, then there is the possibility of a minor cabinet reshuffle later this week after Parliament goes into recess on March 13. There is also the issue of the return of the Trinamul Congress'' Mamata Banerjee. At a recent meeting among Vajpayee, Advani and Naidu, the PM had spoken of bringing in Mamata and the National Conference''s Farooq Abdullah. But Mamata''s name had not found favour with Advani, who was soon after visited by her rival Sudip Bandopadhyaya, putting forward his claim as well."	1
UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations has added two more individuals to its list of persons having links with the Taliban terror group subject to sanctions.The Security Council committee monitoring sanctions decided to include Indonesia-born Riduan Nurjaman Samuddin and Iqbal Mohamad Abdurrahman to the list on the basis of information provided by the member states.The sanctions require states to freeze financial resources, including funds derived or generated by any undertaking owned or controlled by the Taliban, and to ensure that they are not used by the group. More than 300 individuals and entities are on the list whose funds the member states are expected to freeze.The Council originally adopted the measures in response to the indictment of Osama Bin Laden for the 1998 terrorist bombings of the United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, and later tightened sanctions.	1
DHUPGURI: With government infrastructure being woefully inadequate, Project Uttarayan, a private endeavour, has brought a ray of hope for the farmers of Dhupguri block in Jalpaiguri district, whic is even facing the prospect of law-and-order problems due to the overproduction of potato.Since the price of potato has gone down to Rs 1,300 per tonne against the minimum production cost of Rs 1,800, farmers are being forced into dumping their potato crop on the road as they failed to arrange for permits to store their produce in cold storages.A potato farmer Md Maidul, sitting on one such road leading to Salbari from Dhupguri, said, aThis is the usual situation for most of the year.a He had to throw away nearly six tonnes of potatoes this year.aA woefully inadequate cold storage capacity of Jalpaiguri encourages black marketing of permits,a said a senior police official. One such permit, costing Rs 2,000, sells in the black market at double the price and eventually leads to scuffles and law-and-order problems,a he added. According to figures available from the state agriculture department, against an average production of 100,000 tonne per year at Dhupguri, the total capacity of the five existing cold storages in this areas is only 50,000 tonnes.Also, barring one, the others are privately owned. However, the farmers are looking forward to an upcoming multi-dimensional potato project, Uttarayan, that awould ease the situation to a great extenta, said a potato wholesaler. Managing director of the new company floating the multi-crore Uttarayan project at Salbari, S. Sarkar, 32, said, aOne should utilise this fertile soil to tap the global market.We are trying to explore other avenues to increase potato consumption among the people, so that farmers can grow more potatoes and earn good returns round the year.a The project, planned as a semi-cooperative and the first phase of which will be launched next year, is looking towards exporting packed potato cubes, powder and alcohol. aFifty per cent of our margin would go towards R&D to prepare some more fascinating avenues,a added Sarkar.	1
PUNE: The onset of monsoon has brought the focus back on the garbage menace in Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) areas.Soggy, overflowing garbage bins and illegally dumped mounds of litter are not only raising a stink in several areas, they are clogging drainage lines and compounding sanitation problems. Among the worst-affected areas are Golibar maidan, Shivaji Market, Gawliwada, J.J.Garden and Ghorpuri Bazaar.Pointing to an overflowing garbage bin opposite the Mangal Vihar restaurant on Thimayya road, Rita Fernandes, a resident of Sachapir Street, said it was always a problem. aWorse still, sewage from a neighbouring public urinal flows onto the street and the garbage container. The place gets filled with dogs, flies and an unbearable stench,a she said.Nitin Bhosle, a resident of Bhimpura near Shivaji market, said public toilet blocks in the area are ill-maintained. aThe sanitation department rarely cleans the toiltet blocks or sprays disinfectants. They even lack basic water supply,a he complained. PCB health superintendent V.S. Kulkarni, however, maintained the PCB was doing its level best to curb the garbage menace. Kulkarni told TNN that the department's 30 sweepers clean all the 55 sanitary blocks in the cantonment area twice a day. aThe toilets are cleaned and sprayed with phenyl, twice in the morning and evening,a he said.The health superintendent said the garbage bins are cleared every day,while those in army areas are cleared every alternate day. It is interesting to note that for population of over four lakh, the PCB has only two dumper trucks, 22 garbage containers and 60 masonry bins.aWe collect nearly 30 tonnes of garbage, both wet and dry, every day. The garbage is dumped at our vermiculture site at St Patrick's Town,a Kulkarni said.His tall claims are, however, exposed by the state of the Golibar maidan, which is right under the nose of the Pune Cantonment Board's headquarters. The indifference of the sanitation department has willy-nilly turned the playground into dumping ground for litter and scrap.	0
"NAGPUR: Govindacharya''s divorce with the BJP is now complete. ""I have decided not to renew my primary membership of the BJP,"" the former general secretary of the party, said here on Sunday.A former pracharak (full-time worker) of the RSS, Govindacharya said he would remain associated with it as a swayamsevak (volunteer).In September 2000, Govindacharya had stepped down as party general secretary seeking a two-year study leave to undertake research on ""effects of globalisation policies on the people of India"".Early this year, he completed his research, in which he found that ""the blindfolded journey on the path of economic globalisation in the last 12 years had failed to solve the basic problems of poverty and unemployment in the country"".The former BJP leader said he did not want to go back to party politics as he had found a ""greater canvass"" to work on. He would now concentrate on the Swadeshi movement. ""While doing my research I toured some 125 places, met over 400 people and referred 150 books to support my study. I found that foreign direct investment in the country is no solution to its economic ills."" Cure for maladies of poverty and unemployment could best be found in the Swadeshi economy and decentralisation, he opined.Govindacharya said he would not campaign for the BJP in the coming elections in Madhya Pradesh, or in the general elections next year, making it clear that he would never be part of active electoral and power politics in future.He, however, endorsed the RSS'' recent shift of stand on the Ayodhya issue, saying the ""legislative solution"" to the issue was a more practical one. ""With out-ofcourt negotiations with the minority community making no headway and the courts in no position to determine on a matter of faith in lord Ram, I personally feel that a legislative solution could be long lasting,"" Govindacharya said. About his relationship with BJP leader Uma Bharti, Govindacharya reiterated, ""There was nothing in it beyond friendship and my respect for her as a sanyasi.""He admitted that he had proposed to marry her in 1991. ""But, after she decided to take sanyas in 1992 at Amarkantak, I respected her decision,"" he added."	0
"NEW DELHI: In a bid to further the Naga peace process, informal discussions between NSCN(I-M) leadership and Centre''s special emissary K Padmanabhaiah are likely to be held abroad next week.These consultations would be followed by another round of formal talks in New Delhi in the next few months, Padmanabhaiah said on Thursday.""While it is difficult to put a time-limit as to when the peace accord would be finalised, the climate at present is extremely favourable for working out a settlement,"" he said.Replying to questions on various aspects of the Naga peace process, he said the newly-elected coalition government in Nagaland was not only favouring the process, but it also has three major NDA partners and nine NDA ministers.Besides, the NSCN (Khaplang) faction was also ""taking a positive attitude"" towards the peace talks, he said.Asked to comment on reports that the Centre aimed at ""disarming"" the NSCN(I-M) cadres through the peace talks, he said ""the question of laying down of arms will arise only when a final settlement is reached ... it is only at that stage.""But in the current phase, the question of laying down of arms (by the NSCN-IM) is not relevant at all. It does not arise"", the Centre''s interlocutor said.Padmanabhaiah cited examples of LTTE and Irish Republican Army saying ""they were fighting for a cause, but only when a political settlement is arrived at, will they disarm""."	1

"MUMBAI: Ruling out a repo rate cut in near future, RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan on Thursday said that the 0.25 per cent cut by US Federal Reserve would have no impact on the macro economy and monetary conditions in India.""RBI''s financial market committee met today to note Federal Reserve''s action and it saw no difference in macro economy and monetary conditions within the country, therefore, there is no reason to change our policy stance"", Mohan told reporters here on the sidelines of a function to launch the multi-banking system for collection of central excise duties.Referring to the repo rate, he said ""there will be no cut for quite some time since neither the type of inflation nor monsoon situations are yet clear"".On inflation, which RBI has placed in the range of 5.0-5.5 per cent for this fiscal, he maintained that the policy stance continued on this front.Mohan, referring to the liquidity situation in India, said, ""It is quite easy at present. We are watching it carefully and will take whatever action is necessary"".""RBI watches the situation on daily basis and actions, which may include a possibility of hiking the notified amount of treasury bills, open market operations and greater borrowings, are always available,"" the deputy governor added.Referring to the foreign inflows and arbitrage opportunities, he said that the Central bank would soon come out with details on composition of inflows for fiscal 2002-03."	0
HYDERABAD: Lower and upper primary students from local government schools, led by Students Federation of India (SFI) representatives held a dharna at the main gate of the department of school education on Tuesday, demanding that authorities print and distribute the remaining quota of 4.14 crore text books to all schools in the state. As on date the government has printed and distributed 4 crore text books that are to be given free to all students up to Class V and from Class VI onwards to certain reserved categories. With government schools reopening on June 15, almost half the students in the state are attending schools without text books, Students Federation of India state secretary T Sagar said during the dharna. Students in the government schools performed exceptionally well in examinations conducted during the last academic year and the non-availability of these text books will only discourage students from academics, Sagar added. The SFI representatives also demanded that the posts lying vacant, which are to be filled through the district service examination, be filled up at least on a contract basis. The other demands of the SFI representatives, contained in the memorandum submitted to Department of School Education director Manmohan Singh include release of contingency fund to schools, providing adequate teaching infrastructure and filling up of vacant watchman posts.	0
