"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that the legality of provisions of the Air Force Act could not be challenged on grounds of being violative of fundamental rights of armed personnel as the restrictions imposed were mandated by the Constitution itself.The ruling was given recently by a Bench comprising Justice N Santosh Hegde and Justice B P Singh while setting aside a 1995 order of Delhi High Court directing reinstatement of ex-Flight Lieutenant G S Bajwa, who was dismissed from service in 1983 for refusing to undergo a medical test.The high court had also directed payment of 50 per cent of back wages to Bajwa from the date of dismissal and the date of judgement but made it subject to his medical fitness.Allowing the appeal of the Union Government, the Bench said court martial proceedings held against Bajwa were in accordance with the provisions of the Air Force Act and rejected the allegation of the dismissed officer that his fundamental rights were violated during court martial trial.Citing various judgements of the apex court, the Bench said, ""it must be held that the provisions of the Act cannot be challenged on the ground that they infringe the fundamental rights guaranteed to the respondent under Article 21 of the Constitution of India."""	0

CHANDIGARH: One of the two absconding accused in the infamous kidney scam, Hardayal Mehta, is likely to surrender to the special investigation team (SIT) in a day or so. He is learnt to have sent feelers to the SIT expressing his willingness to join the investigation after having remained on the run for more than three months. The SIT had initiated proceedings to declare him a proclaimed offender.Mehta, who was manager of Kakkar Nursing Home, is believed to be privy to the clandestine functioning of doctors and the nursing home staff in promoting the kidney trade racket. If he surrenders, Bhushan Aggarwal would be the only person still to fall in the SIT dragnet.	0

"RAIPUR: Brahmins and members of the trading and business communities figured low in chief minister Ajit Jogi''s list of priorities. He had often criticised Brahmins and Marwaris both inside and outside the assembly. But the onset of election year has changed all that. Jogi started dinner diplomacy by hosting dinner for the Brahmins at his bungalow last week.The dinner was attended by 2,000 Brahmins, including ministers, legislators, bureaucrats and journalists. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian items were served.He followed it up by appointing a Brahmin lawyer as chairman of the state social welfare board though he declared he would not open any new corporation or board as part of his austerity drive.The chief minister''s next dinner invitation was extended to another community which was considered close to the BJP and hostile to the tribals a""-the Agarwals.The Agarwals, too, responded in fairly large numbers."	0
SRINAGAR: Even though Jammu and Kashmir recorded a fiscal deficit of Rs 955 crore during the current year, the Mufti government presented a zero-deficit budget in state legislative assembly on Tuesday.Announcing the measures for fiscal reforms in the state, Jammu and Kashmir finance and planning minister Muzzfar Hussian Beig informed the House that petrol, liquor, chicken and mutton will be costlier in the state.He said the Union finance ministry had agreed in principle to give the state a higher share in the debt swap scheme which would enable the state repay a substantial part of the debt towards the Centre. He said the state will move to the value added tax (VAT) system from October 1, 2003.Pronouncing new proposal in the House, the minister said the import duty will be increased by Rs 5 per LPL, while license fee will be marginally increased for bars attached with hotels, restaurants, distilleries, brewery and bottling plants.A levy of toll on ad-unitum basis on chicks/chicken imported to the state at Rs 2 per bird would be imposed while Rs 10 to Rs 25 per cattle would be charged during the import of the animal, Bieg said.For development of roads, the government has proposed a levy of cess on motor spirit at the rate of Re 1 per litre sold in Jammu and Kashmir. This is for the first that the state has decided its own plan size instead of the Planning Commission fixing it, the minister said.He said that the plan size worked out for the state was Rs 2,500 crore with capital component of Rs 1,627 crore and revenue component of Rs 873 crore.Rs 100 crore would be provided in the plan for meeting the state''s share in centrally sponsored schemes. This will enable the state to get Rs 500 to Rs 600 crore from centrally sponsored schemes over and above the Rs 2500 plan.Stressing on the state''s own revenue, Beig said that there would be increase by 15 per cent on the tax revenue in Jammu and Kashmir.	1
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ordered a further stay on the trial of the three Hinduja brothers in the 17-year-old Bofors pay-off case. It will hear on March 11 the CBI's appeal against the Delhi High Court order, which had quashed the charges against them.On Friday, the court declined to pass any order on the trial. A Bench, headed by Chief Justice V N Khare, said the CBI application's seeking day- to-day trial would also be heard on March 11.CBI's counsel and Solicitor- General Kirit N Rawal said a Bench of the Supreme Court, headed by the then Chief Justice B N Kirpal, had earlier allowed the trial to continue and stayed the Delhi HC order.However, another Bench headed by his successor, Chief Justice G B Pattanaik, in December last year modified that order and stayed the trial proceedings till the disposal of the CBI's appeal.On the apex court's direction, a special court was set up to conduct day-to-day trial of the case, Rawal said, requesting the Bench that the trial be allowed to continue.The Bench, which allowed an application by Swedish gun company A B Bofors for impleadment in the matter before it, directed that the CBI application would be heard along with the main appeal on March 11.Another Bench of the SC, headed by Justice M B Shah, adjourned the hearing on a petition filed by one of the Hinduja brothers, seeking relaxation of the bail conditions. While granting bail to the three brothers, the court had imposed a condition that at any point of time, one of the brothers had to stay back in India.	0
"NEW DELHI: The BJP may be in favour of totally banning cow slaughter but the coalition government of which it is a part in Nagaland is not interested in a beef ban.Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio told The Times of India on Tuesday that his administration would oppose any move by the Centre to introduce a law banning cow slaughter. ``We Nagas are a beef-eating people.How can we support such a ban? We traditionally breed cattle and deal in that trade,'''' Rio said. Asked what the state government''s stand would be were the Centre to bring such a law, Rio said: ``How can they bring such a law? We are a secular country comprising people belonging to different religious and cultural milieus.'''' He then added, ``What if the government proposes to ban chicken eating? Would it be accepted?''''Rio spoke to this correspondent on the sidelines of his first press briefing held here on Tuesday.Asked about his meeting with deputy prime minister L K Advani, Rio said it was essentially a courtesy call as he knew Advani very well because as former state home minister he had constantly been in touch with him. Then he added in jest, ``I have also made a BJP man home minister, Dr T M Lotha, so that we can get prompt support from the Centre in any difficulty.''''Elaborating on the issue of unification of Naga inhabited areas, Rio said, ``This is not a new issues. It was agreed upon by the Centre in an accord way back in 1960.''''However, he added that ``the integration process has to be worked out. We have to discuss. We cannot take something by force, neither can we give away something to force. This has to be done through the will of the people.''''He then added that ``integration (of Naga areas) is a commitment of the government of India. I am talking about clause 13 of the 16-point agreement of 1960. The state assembly has also passed resolutions to this effect thrice in the past.''''On the question of the Naga peace process, Rio said his government was committed to it and was considering launching a ``peace mission'''' as was done by Jayaprakash Narayan, Reverend Michael Scott and B P Chaliha three decades ago. He further said that, ``a united overground civil society should carry forward the message to the underground factions and (strive to) bring unity among them so that they speak with one voice."""	0
"<div class=""section1""><div class=""Normal"">PATNA: The opposition along with some members of the ruling coalition in the legislative council on Tuesday forced the state government into a corner by levelling charges of discrimination in giving compensation to the victims of fake encounters on the basis of acaste and religion.a<br /><br />Minister for labour and employment Upendra Prasad Verma, however, did not agree to discussion on the issue, saying that the government could not be asked to explain about the use of discretionary grant in the council.He was replying to a special debate on the law and order situation. The minister ignored vociferous protests even from Mahachandra Prasad Singh (Congress) and Basudeo Singh (CPM).<br /><br />Opening the debate, P K Sinha (Samata) charged the state government with discrimination in giving compensation. He referred to the recent killing of two persons at Manjhaul in Begusarai district and three students at Ashiana Nagar in Patna in afake encountersa and the murder of the Pesh Imam of a mosque in Munger in this connection. He said as the victims in the Manjhaul incident belonged to upper caste, their kin were not given a single paisa as compensation. <br /><br />But as the Pesh Imam belonged to a minority community, his family was given Rs 1 lakh as compensation. Since the three persons killed in the Ashiana Nagar incident came from the Yadav community, their families were given Rs 5 lakh each. The high court in its order in a PIL case has made it clear that discretionary grant cannot be ainjudicious and discriminatory,a he maintained.<br /><br />Sinha referred to and displayed <span style="""" font-style:="""" italic="""">The Times of India</span> report aKidnapping grows into a Rs 300-crore industrya published in its March 24 issue based on an interview with a top-ranking police officer who said that thanks to the well-knit syndicate of criminals, police and politicians, kidnapping in the state has become a big industry having its roots across the country.<br /><br />Verma, in course of his reply, expressed his serious concern over Sinha referring to a newspaper report in the House without discussing it before with the authorities concerned. Ramkripal Yadav (RJD) could not keep his cool in the face of scathing attack by Sinha on the government. This derailed the debate for some time. Later, Yadav participated in the debate along with Giriraj Singh (BJP), B N Lal, Kedar Pandey (both CPI), Tanvir Hassan (JD), Arun Kumar and Sheonandan Prasad Singh (both Congress).</div> </div>"	1
RAIPUR: The BJP has always maintained that when it comes to leadership, it will always score against the Congress as long as the battle between the two parties is seen as a Vajpayee-Sonia face-off. But here, less than 24 hours into the three-day national executive meeting to discuss electoral strategy, the Sonia factor surfaced, with law minister Arun Jaitley contradicting party general secretary Mukthar Abbas Naqvi on what the BJP really thought of her.At a late afternoon briefing, Naqvi, responding to a question, said the BJP did not plan to make the Congress president''s foreign origins into an election issue. However, he added, he knew the subject would inevitably crop up during the campaigning as it was ``linked'''' to national interests. ``She is in India and the Congress has chosen her as its president. The Congress is free to choose anyone as its president, even Musharraf. But when someone becomes the prime minister, many issues crop up (at work) that relate to national interests and security...Only someone born on Indian soil would be sensitive and mindful of Indian interests, including security.''''By mid-evening, Naqvi''s comment, virtually implying that Sonia was a ``security threat'''', looked as though it would snowball into a controversy. So it was left to Jaitley to set the record ``straight''''.Asked whether the BJP considered Sonia a ``security threat'''', Jaitley said: ``Neither has Naqvi nor does the BJP believe that the issue of foreign origin relates to security threats as some friends have tended to presume. The issue of a constitutional office-holder being a natural-born citizen is a political issue. The party certainly feels that experience, ability, the capacity to lead the country are principal considerations for leadership and not being born in or related to a particular family. And we would like to keep the subject at the level of a constitutional and political issue, and not extend it to a personalised attack on the leader of another party.''''The Sonia controversy here comes in the wake of party leaders sending mixed signals on the subject. Only recently, Naqvi, at a party briefing in Delhi had said that Sonia''s foreign origin would not be an issue. Later, the same day, another senior party functionary said: ``In the last elections, Sonia convincingly won two Lok Sabha seats, one in Uttar Pradesh and the other in Karnataka. Clearly, the question of foreign origin does not resonate with the people.''''Yet within a few days, a statement from party president M Venkaiah Naidu touring the south said the BJP would make Sonia''s foreign origin one of its election issues.However, in his presidential speech here on Friday morning, Naidu made no reference to Sonia''s foreign origin. He only took a swipe at the fact that she was leading the Congress because of her connection with the Nehru-Gandhi family. Comparing her unfavourably with Vajpayee, Naidu said: ``...All the Congress can do is take shelter under the Dynasty.''''	1
"BHOPAL: Circumventing the Centre, the Madhya Pradesh government on Tuesday shot off a letter to the director-general Archeological Survey of India (ASI) asking the department to issue direct orders regarding Bhojshala.On Friday, the state government had received a letter from the ASI which said that the Centre's February 26 recommendations for the entry of Hindus into Bhojshala may be implemented by the state after considering the law and order situation. In reply, the Digvijay Singh government has written to the ASI asking for ""orders"" whether or not to open Bhojshala for Hindus.The Union tourism and culture ministry had recommended that Bhojshala be thrown open for Hindus on Tuesdays from sunrise to sunset and the devotees be permitted to take in a few grains of rice and a flower or two as offering while Muslims may carry on their namaz prayers on Friday afternoons for two hours.""Till now we have only received recommendations and suggestions. We want orders,"" state home minister Mahendra Baudh said.Baudh said the Centre has no legitimate authority to pass direct orders on the entry of Hindus into Bhojshala. Quoting rule four of the Ancient Monuments and Archeological Sites Rules, 1959, Baudh said only the ASI director-general, by order, can direct whether Hindus should be permitted entry into Bhojshala.""In February 1998, it was the director-general of ASI who had passed the order permitting the entry of Muslims into Bhojshala every Friday for namaz and Hindus on Basant Panchmi only. And it is the D-G, ASI, who has the legitimate right to issue fresh orders. Hence, we have sent the letter to the ASI,"" he said.Baudh also alleged that the Centre was ""deliberately and purposefully creating law and order problems for the state through the Bhojshala issue"". Speaking to the Press, the state home minister accused: ""We have repeatedly informed the Centre of the possible dangers to the law and order situation in MP if the Bhojshala issue is provoked this way. But the Centre is deliberately creating problems for us. Law and order maybe a state subject but the Centre has a responsibility to maintain law and order situation in the country."""	0
GUWAHATI: The death toll in Sunday''s bomb blast triggered by the Ulfa in Goalpara district of Assam rose to seven on Monday with one of the injured succumbing to his injuries, official sources said.The proscribed Ulfa had in a major offensive on Sunday killed six persons and injured 55 others, one of whom died in a hospital on Monday.

It referred to shared beliefs, customs and traditions followed by people over several centuries,"" he said.Swamy Abhayananda Maharaj, who presided, said politicians, with their eye on the vote bank, were responsible for most of the problems in society."	1
CHANDIGARH: Experts deliberating on bronchial problems and related disorders at the 'International Conference on Bronchology and Respiratory Diseases' which gets underway from February 13 at Jalandhar will press upon the Punjab government for rigorous enforcement of the ban on smoking in public places. The conference would be inaugurated by Punjab governor Lt Gen (retd) J F R Jacob.Addressing a press conference here on Friday, organising secretary Dr H J Singh said, ''Recent studies show that while smoking has substantially gone down among men in Europe, the situation in India is quite the reverse.Keeping in mind that smoking among men is on the rise in the country, we will seek the intervention of Punjab government for stronger enforcement of the ban on smoking in pubic places which is violated more often than not.''Elaborating on the matter, he said, ''Smoking is a major social problem which plagues the society. Though the ill-effects of smoking are well-known, the ban on smoking continues to be flouted everywhere. Statistics show that smoking is the causal factor of lung cancer in 95 per cent of the cases.The active participation of the government is needed to boost the smoking cessation programme.'' Detailed sessions on lung cancer would be held during the conference where the focus apart from the treatment and management of lung cancer, would also be on factors leading to lung cancer to create increased mass awareness about the pitfalls of smoking.To be attended by about 500 doctors across the country and 11 international experts including Dr Hiokuni Yoshimura, president, World Association for Bronchology, Dr Takehiko Fujisawa, head, Thoracic surgery department, Chiba University, Japan, and others from the USA, Czech Republic, Australia, the conference would provide the assembled audience to interact with Dr Udaya Prakash, president, American College of Chest Physicians, the only Indian to have bagged the prestigious position.The conference would also focus on the use of lasers bronchoscopy and latest treatment modes available for the treatment of chronic bronchitis and asthma.

DHARWAD: With elections to the post of Mayor of the Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation two months away, the aspirants have begun to pull strings. Mayor Prakash Kyarakatti's term ends in the first week of June and it is now the turn of corporators from Dharwad to occupy the coveted seat, if one goes by convention.Firdous Konnur was the first mayor after the new civic body was formed and Prakash Kyarakatti succeeded him.Both are from Hubli. While the post was reserved for a minority candidate during the first year, it was the turn of the SC/ST candidate to take the reins during the second year. There is speculation that the seat would be open to general category, and this time, should go to a candidate from Dharwad. The Congress has a majority in the House of 67 with 24 seats, followed by BJP (22), Janata Dal-S (12), Independents (6) and Janata Dal-U (3).The Congress had enjoyed the support of Janata Dal (S) and Independents while the BJP chose to sit in the opposition. Dharwad has 23 corporators, and of them, 13 are women. With a Congress corporator from Dharwad likely to occupy the chair, Chandan Savadi and Hanumanthappa Betageri are in the forefront as they are the only two male Congress members. Basaveshwar Agadi, an Independent, is another contender who enjoys the support of members from other parties. While corporators from Dharwad are bringing pressure on the Congress leadership to allot the seat to Dharwad this time, there are pressures from aspirants from Hubli to allow a third term to Hubli.Leader of the House Anilkumar Patil, who belongs to the general category, is a strong aspirant and is expected to use all his clout to have the seat open for general category, and occupy the chair. Knowing his clout with minister for urban development D.K. Shivakumar, Anilkumar may not have much difficulty in succeeding in his mission. The Congress lobby in Dharwad is not strong enough to counter him. But a former minister from Dharwad is said to support Anilkumar, as he does not want the emergence of another aspirant in Dharwad for the party ticket for the Assembly seat. But rival forces within the Congress and outside may throw a spoke in the wheel and try to sabotage Anilkumar's chances. In such an event, Basaveshwar Agadi may emerge as a candidate with the ability to upset the Congress apple cart.Agadi is the chairman of HDMC's Standing Committee on Taxation and Finance, he does not have party bindings but has sympathisers across the House. Hanumanthappa Betageri is a staunch supporter of former minister S.R. Morey and the latter may support his candidature. With elections to Assembly and Parliament scheduled in September-October 2004, the Congress, which holds the reins, will have to tread carefully to avoid any embarrassment.	0

"NEW DELHI: Yamini Yadav recently came to Delhi from Singapore to nurse her ailing mother who lives in Kalkaji. But after a month-long stay, she is herself feeling sick because of the water crisis in the city. ""I wake up at 3 am everyday to switch on the pump. Then I turn on the tap to store water,"" said the 32-year-old Yamini. This way, she ensures that the underground tank and buckets are full and water is filtered for drinking.By the time the tap starts to run dry again around 6.30 am, it is too late to sleep again. ""I feel drowsy and tired the entire day. Think about the people who have to go to office after doing all this,"" she said. Today she just hopes that her mother recuperates and she is able to fly back to her Singapore home. Mohini Khanna in Janakpuri is luckier though. She wakes up at 6 am, a good three hours after Yamini. ""But we just get water at very low pressure for about an hour in morning and half-an-hour in the evening,"" she said. A senior Delhi Jal Board (DJB) official had said water is supplied at those hours in some critical areas ""in the hope that not everyone will switch on their online motors and people at end of the supply line will also get some water."" But even this plan doesn't seem to be working. Said D M Narang, an RWA member in New Rajinder Nagar that gets water from 4 am to 7 am, ""The supply is highly inadequate and several houses don't get any water at all."" With the DJB supply down to a trickle in many parts of the city, people have no option but to rely on tankers. ""Since we get water for about 15 minutes a day, we depend fully on tankers. But many times after calling up the DJB complaint centre, a private tanker that charges Rs 100 for 500 litres of water lands at our doorstep,"" said R S Chaudhary of Vasant Kunj.

""The proximity of our plots to the Haiderpur treatment plant is the reason why we are better off,"" he said."	1
"CHANDIGARH: With Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) finally making an announcement on attaching Panchkula and Mohali with different short distance charging areas (SDCA), telephone subscribers in these townships will now be faced with a new set of realities in the coming days.As far as telecommunications go, residents of Mohali and Panchkula had come to identify themselves with Chandigarh and the perception will be in for a change in the coming days.BSNL officials say that these cities were not meant to be a part of the Chandigarh telecom area from the beginning, but were made part of the Chandigarh SDCA solely on account of convenience.Officials say that whereas Panchkula was meant to be a part of the Ambala SDCA, Mohali was to go with Kharar. The erstwhile telecom department had distributed the SDCAs as per the distribution of the set-ups for civil administration.However, the two were clubbed with Chandigarh due to proximity to the city. The proposed system announced by BSNL will not only effect the existing customers, but will also have a bearing on the operations of cellular companies. So far, Panchkula has been considered as a part of the Punjab circle, and cellular operators with a license for Punjab territory, had been catering to customers in the city.BSNL officials say that as and when the new arrangement is put in place, like Mohali, Panchkula too will have a changed STD number and will be a part of the Haryana administrative circle for all practical purposes.However, the move puts a question mark over the status of the cellular companies operational in Panchkula. For it will mean that the Panchkula territory will go with the cellular company providing mobile services in Haryana.At present, the city is being catered to by cellular operators in Punjab. ""We have learnt of the BSNL announcement of attaching Panchkula with Ambala SDCA, but there has been no official communication,"" says Mukul Khanna of Spice Communications."	0
"NEW DELHI: A crucial meet of the Sangh Parivar, involving the top brass of BJP, RSS, VHP and other outfits, began in the capital on Thursday amid emphasis on increased coordination and restrained mutual criticism.The high level parleys were attended by among others Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and RSS Chief K S Sudarshan.Vajpayee spent about three hours at the meeting called by RSS to discuss among other issues Ayodhya, Kashmir and the Centre''s economic policies including disinvestment over which Parivar outfits have varied and conflicting viewpoints.""The objective of the meet is to exchange notes and ideas. Different mass organisations face problems which they would put before the decision makers for appropriate action. The idea is to have a common perspective,"" RSS Joint General Secretary Madan Das Devi told reporters during lunch.He said the Prime Minister keenly listened to the discussions on how coordination among the various outfits can be improved and a mechanism involving MPs led by Ministers be evolved to elicit the opinion of Parivar outfits and sections of industry, labour and students on key social and economic issues.""This would ensure least resistance to policies. Besides, government can also explain its stand to the various sections,"" said Devi, who also looks after the affairs of BJP.Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, Union Ministers Murli Manohar Joshi and Arun Jaitley, BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu, VHP leaders Ashok Singhal and Praveen Togadia and leaders of Parivar outfits such as BMS, BKS, ABVP, Vidya Bharati and Vanvasi Kalyani Ashram were among the 45 odd participants."	0
CHANDIGARH: The city administration on Wednesday demolished nine farm houses and marriage palaces on the periphery of Chandigarh. Some of these properties belong to Venod Sharma, former Congress MP from here, Yashpal Mahajan, a BJP leader and Kewal Dhillon, an industrialist.These properties covered an area of over 30 acres. Demolition notices had been issued in 2002 but follow-up action took place only on Wednesday.	0
MUMBAI: The Gujarat police has sought the help of the city police to track down alleged Dawood-aides Farooq Devadiwala and Shagir Ahmed Shaikh, both suspected to be involved in the murder of former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Sources said Devadiwala is a lieutenant of Karachi-based gangster Dawood Ibrahim and controls the gang's operations in Gujarat.Shaikh was among the top ten most wanted gangsters of Mumbai. He had surrendered before the Hyderabad police few years ago since he feared that he would be killed in an encounter by the Mumbai police. He was later released on bail.But he allegedly jumped bail and is believed to be in Gujarat, police sources said. Intelligence sources suspect that Mr Pandya was killed by the Dawood gang at the behest of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). They believe it was to embarrass Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.	1
KOLKATA: He is there yet not quite. Rebel Trinamul MP Ajit Panja feels that the people have chosen the Congress as the main Opposition in West Bengal and has rejected the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine. Yet, he is yet to take the plunge and join the Congress.Panja, who had described the Vidyasagar by-poll as an acid test which would determine his political future, said after election results came out on Wednesday that he would first analyze the results of Vidyasagar assembly byelection and Nabadwip Lok Sabha bypoll at the executive meeting of his present organisation Mukta Mancha next week-end before deciding his future political steps.aI have made up my mind. There is no harm and no legal hurdle if I continue to work with the Congress. Vidyasagar results show that Congress has been chosen as the principal Opposition in this state. But my future political steps will be decided by the executive committee of the Mukta Mancha,a Panja said.The rebel Trinamul MP said he was in regular touch with the state Congress leadership including Somen Mitra, Pradeep Bhattacharjee and Manas Bhuinya and would review the election results with them within two-three days.Panja, who had thrown his weight behind his daughter and Congress candidate in Vidyasagar, Mohua Mondol, however, felt that Congress lacked a proper election machinery.aThe CPM did not resort to violence or booth capturing this time. Instead they deleted names from the voters' list and cast proxy votes in over 40 booths.The Congress did not have adequate machinery to stop it,a Panja observed.	1
LUCKNOW: When the government is busy preparing action plans and involving the state machinery to ambush people with various activities that ideally must be from a political platform, simultaneously literature and the 'erstwhile' culture seems to be sidelined. In this process, the UP Urdu Akademi has been reduced to what can, at best, be identified with reminisces of an era which spoke of the glorious culture of the city of nawabs and also of the contribution of Lucknow and the state to the country's intellectual wealth.A visit to the Akademi building in Gomtinagar can be an eye-opener. Though it can neither complain of lack of infrastructure nor of funds, yet the wheels seemed to have clogged with government apathy. The annual government aid touches Rs 70 lakh, according to a senior official of the Akademi, but they are not in a position to utilise any of it to promote various activities that lend a meaningful existence to the institution.As its activities, to a large extent, have remained suspended for the past several years, the UP Progressive Writers' Association has expressed its anguish and dismay over the present state of affairs of the Akademi, the first of its kind in the country.At the moment, the Akademi is working without the general council, the executive, the chairman and the president. And as a member of the association, Abid Suhail says, the present set-up is naturally not answerable to anybody. Since the time the chairman resigned, there has been no meeting and no member of the council has turned up at the Akademi. Apparently, members have taken for granted that the council stands dissolved, says the official.The Akademi has even apprised the secretary, language, of the state, but even after repeated reminders, the secretary has not been able to find time for a task which comes directly under his jurisdiction. Apart from the secretary, language, others responsible for the Akademi's functioning are secretary finance, education and national integration and the director, information. No one, however, seems to take interest in restoring the past glory. Though more than 50 per cent of the aid goes in salaries, the rest 'earlier' went to preserve, foster and develop Urdu language and its literature. This it did, firstly by encouraging and publishing original works of literary and academic merit, besides translation of various literary and scientific works in Urdu. A major objective of the Akademi was to help deserving authors of Urdu in publishing their works and also to award them for the works published. The Akademi also gave financial assistance to old and needy authors of Urdu, besides providing financial assistance for advanced studies to Urdu scholars. The Akademi also invited eminent scholars to deliver lectures, held seminars and conferences, but all of it has come to a grinding halt in the absence of a council and its head.The UP Progressive Writers' Association has, therefore, demanded the setting up of all the bodies of the Akademi as per its constitution so that it may resume its activities.	1
"MUMBAI: Two employees of Amar Cafe in Matunga are believed to have murdered the restaurant owner Shaukat Gafoor (37) early Sunday morning because they were denied a hike in salary.The suspects, whose names were given as Sanjay (24) and Sahay (18), are absconding.Mr Gafoor slept in the restaurant situated at the junction of Naigaum Cross Road and D.A.Road in the jurisdiction of the Matunga police station.

"You may have visited a gift shop, some time or the other or any shop, where you bought goods and asked the shopkeeper to pack the purchased goods. Seems trivial enough, doesn't it? But, no one could have imagined some years ago that packaging of goods would be a lucrative career option, that too entailing a lot of interesting facets in learning and opportunities opening up in various sectors, including exports.""There is a revolution in the field of packaging especially for consumer products and the trend has accelerated due to liberalisation of the economy,"" said N C Saha, joint director and head, Northern Regional Centre, Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP), Delhi. The IIP is an autonomous body, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. The institute has three regional centres at Chennai, Kolkata and Delhi and is headquartered at Mumbai. It is involved in various activities like testing, training and consultancy, in the field of packaging. Saha said: ""Food articles, pharmaceutical products, cosmetics, engineering or electronic goods require optimum package design in order to be sent safely from the production centre to the consumer, by incurring minimum cost. Hence, packaging can be defined as a techno-economic means for minimising cost of delivery and maximising sales. It is a combination of science, art and technology as well."" According to Saha, there were around 20,000 packaging industries comprising packaging raw-material manufacturers. He remarked that most of these industries belonged to the small-scale sector and only 700 to 800 industries fell under the large-scale sector. ""Considering the growing demand for packaging in the consumer market, most of the consumer products' manufacturing companies require packaging professionals for procuring consistent qualitative packaging materials at the right cost. In addition to this, purchase and marketing departments of various companies require packaging experts,"" he pointed out. Speaking on career prospects Saha remarked: ""Today, there is a tremendous demand in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, for skilled packaging professionals."" The IIP offers two programmes: A two-year 'Post Graduate Diploma in Packaging Technology' and a three-month 'Certificate Programme in Packaging'. Giving a detailed outline of the programmes, Saha said the PG programme comprised different topics related to packaging as well as subjects such as mechanical engineering, applied mechanics, electrical technology, machine drawing and economics among others. The eligibility to join the programme is a graduation with physics, chemistry, mathematics and microbiology as one of the main subjects or graduates in agriculture, food science, engineering or technology with 55 per cent marks. ""There is a 'Joint Entrance Test' at all four centres of the institute,"" remarked Saha. He added, ""For the certificate course any graduate or a person with three years of experience in the packaging industry, can apply. The certificate course covers all aspects of packaging, in addition to 20 to 25 factory visits. A science graduate is preferred for this course."" According to Saha, one could start with an initial salary of Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per month after doing the certificate programme while the starting salary for PG diploma students hovered around Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 per month. The PG diploma programme will commence on August 5 this year while the certificate programme usually commences in the month of September every year. E-mail: iipdelhi@nde.vsnl.net.in"	1
As the mercury goes on rising, people start wishing for rain. The start of rainy season is also known as the arrival of monsoon. The word 'monsoon' actually means season. The term is derived from the Arabic word 'mausim' which refers to a type of seasonal winds which blow from the sea to land during summer or from land to sea during winter.We all know that land masses heat and cool more quickly than the surrounding water areas or seas.Let us take our continent Asia for example. During the summer season, the land masses are very hot so pressure weakens over them and cooler rain bearing winds flow from the seas towards the land. This moist air causes rainfall. In winter, the land masses are dry and the pressure is high.So the winter rain bearing winds blow away from the coasts. This is called as the Southwest monsoon and the Northeast monsoon respectively in India. The Southwest monsoon season usually falls between July and September and the Northeast monsoon during the months of November and December. In our world, monsoon covers the continents of Asia, Africa and South-America.Most of the world's population live in monsoon regions, as they are good for agriculture due to the availability of rainwater. As most of the agricultural activities are dependent on monsoon, it could be said that monsoon sustains life. Every year we pray and look forward to a normal monsoon.

HYDERABAD: The winding up speech by Congress member Dharmana Prasada Rao on the budget in the Assembly on Monday witnessed interesting exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches.Referring to chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu's penchant to make promises, Prasada Rao compared him to Sri Krishnadevaraya and finance minister Y Ramakrishnudu to his court jester Tenali Ramakrishna.Prasada Rao said the finance minister was hard pressed to fulfill the promises made by the CM.Prasada Rao said Naidu's claims on not sleeping or allowing others to sleep until the state had developed was actually due to the mounting debts, sending the House into peals of laughter. Finance minister Y Ramakrishnudu intervened and inquired if the leader of opposition Y S Rajasekhara Reddy could sleep well with the loan he took from the World Bank.Taking a dig at the unrealistic promises of the chief minister, the Congress member said Naidu on a recent trip to Srikakulam had promised cell phones to the members of the self-help groups.Referring to the repeated criticism of the Congress by the ruling party on the groups within the opposition, he said the various groups worked to protect the interest of the people adding that the group leaders actually worked as counter checks to the each other and prevent Congress chief ministers from taking anti-people measures.Prasada Rao added that the groups had never harmed the interests of the people unlike the one man dominance in the parties like the TDP.Intervening in the speech, excise minister Seetharam said the group rivalry within the Congress and their leader's thirst for power had led to communal violence and disrespect to the prime minister of the country. He said the TDP was proud of the leadership of Naidu.Referring to the proposed power cut to the agriculture sector after the conclusion of the Assembly, Prasada Rao said he would resign from the House with the approval of the CLP leader if the government went ahead with the decision.Prasad Rao also criticised the Performance Budget, the policies of the government for not delegating powers to the local bodies and for failing to provide adequate support to the weavers and farmers.	1
"JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Sunday said his government was trying to evolve a consensus on major issues and asked people to give it more time to put things on right track.""The coalition government does not have a magic lamp to change the system overnight. It should be given time to put things on right track,"" Sayeed told a public meeting at Kathua, some 88 kms from here, on Saturday evening.The government was trying to evolve a consensus on major issues within and outside the state, he said adding it needed more time to prove that it was honestly working for betterment of the people. On opposition criticism of his government on issues like Pota, the Chief Minister said the ground situation had improved despite his government not resorting to the use of the measure.""We do not wish to claim that everything has been set right, but the fact remains that things are looking up as people''s pressure is mounting on us to deliver more and more,"" he said.""My government''s endeavour is put off the internal fire that has taken a heavy toll of our people.""Exuding confidence to change the system, the Chief Minister said the task was herculean but not insurmountable.

JALANDHAR: The situation in the city on Friday remained tense but under control, a day after one person was killed and 21 injured in violent clashes between the Jat and dalit communities in the city and Talhan village, about 15 km from here. Incidents of arson and hooliganism were reported from Rama Mandi, Maksoodan and the worst-affected Boota Mandi even as a number of policemen were deployed in the affected areas, particularly on the two-km stretch from Nakodar Chowk to Wadala Chowk.An irate mob of dalit youths set on fire a bus of Punjab Roadways at Maksoodan, while two buses, belonging to the Himachal Pradesh Transport Corporation and a private company, Doaba Roadways, were damaged in stone-pelting at Rama Mandi. A liquor vend and a post office were targeted at Boota Mandi. The curfew imposed in Talhan village since 7 pm on Thursday was not lifted till Friday night, though a senior official told Times News Network that the deputy commissioner (DC) had been advised to relax the curfew. Dalit Action Committee president Chanan Ram Pal, talking to Times News Network over telephone from Talhan, alleged that the curfew was being strictly enforced only in dalit-dominated areas. ''The dalit families, which comprise about 70 per cent of the population of the village, fear that they would be attacked at night,'' he said, adding that they had noticed Jat youths carrying swords on the roofs of their houses. Chanan Ram said the power supply to the village had been snapped since noon. ''I had requested the DC on Thursday for the deployment of CRPF personnel at the village, since we we have no faith in the Punjab police who acted in a biased manner,'' he said, claiming that he tried to contact the DC again on his mobile phone on Friday, but could not get through. A press note issued by the district public relations office in the evening said, quoting the DC, that the curfew would be relaxed from Saturday. Jalandhar additional deputy commissioner B S Multani would conduct a magisterial inquiry into the incident and submit the inquiry report within 15 days, said the release. Section 144, CrPC will continue to be imposed in the district till June 12. Meanwhile, a ministerial team, including Lal Singh, Avtar Henry and Chaudhary Santokh Singh, visited the injured at Civil Hospital late in the afternoon, along with local bodies minister Chaudhary Jagjit Singh and technical education minister Mohinder Singh Kaypee. They announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the family of the deceased, Rs 25,000 each for the seriously injured and Rs 5,000 each for those who had sustained minor injuries. The team expressed confidence that after the inquiry it would be known who were behind the clashes. The team members claimed it was an act of sabotage aimed at derailing the negotiations being brokered by the district administration over the last few days to bring about a compromise between the warring groups. Though the team members persistently said that anti-social elements could be behind the incidents, local bodies minister Chaudhary Jagjit Singh alleged it was the handiwork of the BSP. No relaxation in Talhan curfew Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday ordered a magisterial inquiry into the violent incidents at Talhan village. He also constituted a high-powered ministerial committee comprising finance minister Lal Singh, local government minister Jagjit Singh, food and supplies minister Avtar Henry, research and medical education minister Santokh Singh and technical education minister Mohinder Singh Kaypee. The team later visited Jalandhar to assess the situation. Amarinder Singh warned that anti-social elements would be dealt with a heavy hand and assured that communal harmony and peace would be maintained at all costs. These decisions were taken at a meeting convened by the CM following violence in Talhan and Jalandhar areas.	1
NEW DELHI: French air force chief General General D''Armee Aerienne Richard Wolsztynski on Friday became the first foreign Service chief to visit the Siachen Glacier, the highest and coldest battlefield in the world.Gen Wolsztynski, on a visit to Leh, flew to the Siachen base camp situated at an altitude of over 3,600 metres, to study the high-altitude search and rescue operations of the IAF.During his visit to India, the French air force chief has held wide-ranging talks with his Indian counterpart, Air Chief Marshal S Krishnaswamy, and also witnessed the first-ever joint Indo-French fighter exercises in Gwalior.

WAGAH: In the midst of a thaw in political atmosphere between India and Pakistan, the resumption of Delhi-Lahore bus service is likely to be a key link in maintaining people-to-people contact between the two countries. The bus service is not only the easiest way to travel to the other country, but symbolises the aspirations of people of two nations who want to sink differences and start afresh. In wake of the restarting of Delhi-Lahore bus from July 11, the customs, immigration and Border Security Force officials are busy, though they maintain that no infrastructure was dismantled when the bus service was discontinued by India following the terrorist attack on Parliament on December 13. The inaugural run of the Delhi-Lahore bus was special as Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee visited Pakistan from February 20-21, 1999 on the invitation of the then prime minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif. Till then, the Samjhauta Express was the only surface transport link between the two countries.Escorted by police, the bus is likely to cover the 526 km distance from Delhi to Lahore in about 14 hours, with a few halts en route. The terminal point in Delhi would be the Ambedkar Stadium while in Lahore it would be Falettis hotel. PS Sodhi, additional commissioner, Customs, told TNN on Tuesday that the department was deploying another half a dozen staff members to expedite the baggage clearance of passengers. aWe have all the required equipment for screening the passengers and the baggage besides searching the bus,a he said.New arrival and departure sign boards are being put up at Wagah. Kulwant Kumar, joint deputy director, Immigration, said though they have infra-red testing equipment to detect forged travel documents, the immigration staff is experienced enough to catch any tampering in passport or visa. He claimed that the bus passengers would be cleared in less than half an hour's time. But, he rue! d the fact that the department lacked in computer connectivity, which would have helped them in remain updated on black-listed people.BSF deputy inspector general Hemant Purohit said they were only responsible for checking the entry and exit of passengers from Zero Line.	1

WARANGAL: Police on Thursday registered a case under Pota against Congress MLA Konda Surekha and her husband Konda Murali on charges of conspiring to murder TDP Chief whip and a police inspector of Hanumakonda town in Andhra Pradesh.The conspiracy was revealed by G Mahipal Reddy during interrogation after he was arrested for carrying a weapon and ammunition with him, police said.Konda Surekha, who represents Syampeta constituency and her husband hatched a conspiracy to kill TDP Chief whip E Dayakar Rao and Inspector Gulam Sadami, police said quoting Mahipal Reddy.Reddy, who was believed to be supplier of ammunition, told during the interrogation that old rivalry between the two families could be the cause for the conspiracy to eliminate Dayakar Rao who represents Wardannapeta constituency.However, police are yet to trace the whereabouts of the accused.	0
LUDHIANA: Ask them to comment on the resumed bus service between Delhi and Lahore, Mehardin and Danyu, the lone illiterate Muslim couple living at Rangowal village, about 30 km from here, react dismissively. In plain words, they will instead ask you to what had actually gone wrong. And after a while looking into each other's eyes, they burst forth into trashing vested interests on both sides of the border for exploiting religion as a tool of hatred.The query draws similar response from the fellow villagers, predominantly Sikhs, who contributed cash and kind in helping the couple construct a small Hindu temple called Mata Rani Da Mandir in the village about two years ago. The village has just two Hindu families with no place of worship before the couple chipped in out of sheer reverence. Before that the villagers used to place their offerings on the side of the path leading to the cremation ground every Tuesday.In fact, the foundation was laid with the bricks the couple had brought from a Hindu shrine from another village. The villagers, including NRI Harbaksh Singh contributed a hand pump and Pritam Singh became the caretaker. Jagran and bhandara are organised annually, said Jagir Singh, a dairy farmer who contributed the maximum in terms of money. Interestingly, no Hindu name is mentioned on the inscription containing names of 26 donors, including one Muslim Sherdin.Firm believers in underlying unity of humankind, they find it strange as to why one could not live in harmony with people of other faiths. Both are regular visitors to the mosque in nearby Ahmedgarh Mandi on every Friday. As a measure of her undefined faith in secularism, Danyu loves being called Dayawanti, a name given by the village women. So much so, she gets upset when called by her real name, said Mehardin. Not that the couple is the lone example of religious harmony, an illiterate resident Malaghar Singh offers solution in terms of respecting religious places of other faiths. He still retains a mosque built on the land allotted to him after migrating from Pakistan. He shudders to think of demolishing the dilapidated structure even though doing so would provide him more space. On the contrary, he is thinking of getting it repaired. Echoing the sentiments of the fellow Muslim couple, Singh denounced rising intolerance along religious lines as rajniti di khel (political game).	0
SHIMLA: Who would form the next government? Speculation is rife as the much-awaited day, February 26, arrives when the fate of all the political parties in the fray would be decided. A lot could depend on weather, which could play a crucial role in the turnout of the electorate. Though both the Congress and the BJP leadership exuded confidence of getting a clear mandate, they are equally apprehensive of the unpredictable weather, especially when one looks back at the past couple of days when rain and snow lashed the state. According to popular opinion here, neither overcast sky nor rain can stop BJP supporters from practising their franchise because they are a committed lot. But the same may not hold true for the Congress. However, insiders in both the parties say that each is confident of winning about 26 to 28 seats. While the CINS poll survey in its latest report has given the Congress 39 seats and the BJP 24, others have been given just two seats. Himachal Creative Network has given 28 seats to the BJP, 27 to the Congress and 10 to others.But Zee television's 'C Voter' has given an edge to the BJP, though not a clear majority. According to its forecast, it should get 28 to 32 seats, the Congress between 26 and 29, the HVC between two and four while others four to six seats. Interestingly, it has given at least three of these seats to the BJP rebels in the fray, like Mohinder Sofat in Solan, Govind Thakur in Kullu and Ch Vidya Sagar in Kangra. One section of people feels that electorate may throw up a hung verdict once again as it did in the 1998 assembly elections. If this happens then the rebels, winning as Independents, and HVC supremo Sukh Ram may again be in the driver's seat.	0
"PATNA: Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ram Jatan Sinha here on Friday chaired the meeting of all the district presidents of Congress. He urged them to remove the communication gap between people and the Congress leader to make the party''s ""Chalo Gaon Ki Or"" campaign a success.He discussed with the district Congress presidents the party programmes in detail and said that not a single lapse in the implementation of the programmes would be tolerated.He said the party workers would have to adhere to their assigned jobs responsibly and honestly. This has to be ensured in order to disseminate the party policies by moving from village to village and bring the rural people to Congress stream, he said.He said that the rank and file of the Congress had a greater role to play in the campaign so that the Congress becomes a major political force in the next elections. He said that the Congress had strong objection to the BJP''s raising a hue and cry over Congress president Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin. He said that Sonia Gandhi had become a symbol of prestige for the country.The meeting passed a resolution, objecting to the statement of the BJP spokesperson, Pramod Mahajan, about Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin. The meeting hailed Sonia Gandhi for nominating Sinha as BPCC president."	0
"NEW DELHI: After the recent high over the anti-communal campaign, the Congress-Left relations have come under severe strain because of the former''s electoral alliance with a tribal outfit in Tripura.The CPM on Wednesday accused the Congress of endangering national unity and integrity by entering into the poll pact with the Indigenous National Party of Tripura (INPT), said to be the political front of the outlawed National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT).""The Congress is once again placing its own political and electoral interest above that of the country''s unity and integrity,"" CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury told reporters.He said though the issue had been taken up with the central Congress leadership, no response was forthcoming. Terming the alliance as unfortunate, Yechury said the Congress had not displayed any ""political maturity"".Yechury, who had met chief election commissioner J M Lyngdoh on Tuesday to seek deployment of Central forces in adequate numbers, released a list of party cadres attacked by the NLFT. ""It is not in the national interest that the Congress have such an alliance in Tripura,"" he said.He pointed out that what was at stake in the remote north-eastern state was the fragile balance between the tribals and others which by extension was a test for national unity.Yechury, however, refused to admit that the escalating violence in the tiny state was a reflection on the administrative abilities of the CPM-led government there. He alleged that the Centre had a ""discriminatory"" approach towards the Tripura government by remaining impervious to the threats of insurgents from across the Bangladesh border.

"NEW DELHI: The high-powered committee tasked by Prime Minister Vajpayee to look into the privatisation of Balco and Modern Foods (MFIL) has found that the interest of workers has been overlooked by the new owners, Sterlite and Hindustan Lever (HLL) respectively. The report will be submitted in July. The committee - comprising one joint secretary each from the disinvestment and labour ministries, RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh president Hasubhai Dave and Employers Federation secretary-general Sharad Patil - was set up by the Prime Minister's Office last year and has visited Balco and MFIL units.According to a highly placed source, ""though the new managements followed the share-purchase agreement by not doing anything to employees in the first year, they began voluntary retirement and even compulsory retirement schemes within days of the stipulated period ending. The spirit of fulfilling a promise is missing."" In Balco, committee sources say, Sterlite ""forced VRS on employees and decided to pay the amount in five instalments. This is against all norms. Those who refused are being troubled through transfers."" Asked by TNN for its reaction to these charges, Sterlite did not reply. In MFIL, the committee report will allege that HLL has also ""flouted norms"". Says a source, ""It is unbelievable that in just over two years, HLL has cut staff strength from 1,650 to 850 and is in the process of shifting its Delhi machinery to Jaipur. The Faridabad unit has already been closed. Their only interest is in the land."" An HLL spokesman justified the staff strength cut. MFIL's ""critical shortcoming was a large workforce and relatively low productivity"", he said. As for VRS, it has been ""implemented in a proper, humane manner with far better terms and benefits to employees"" than before privatisation."	0
"MADIKERI: The citizens of Kushalanagar in the district are experiencing a weird version of doppelganger with both the civic bodies, which are tasked with administering the town, being kept in suspended animation.Before the advent of Zilla Panchayats that replaced Zilla Parishats, Kushalnagar was governed under the then prevalent Town Municipal Council Act and many development works were taken up by the municipal administration.After Zilla Panchayats took birth, Kushalanagar Municipal Council was downgraded to Gram Panchayat for reasons best known to the government.With that underrating, the civic administration was given the cold-shoulder and development works were almost stopped. The citizens fought a pitched battle with the government to restore Kushalnagar the status of Town Panchayat.The Karnataka government gave in and issued an order, upgrading Kushalanagar Gram Panchayat to Town Panchayat on September 13, 2002 and appointed V Balachandra as its chief officer.However, the decision could not be maintained as the State Election Commission, keeping in view the reclassification of panchayat areas, issued a circular that the status of all panchayat bodies in Karnataka be kept the same and the existing system should not be disturbed.The government kept mum, toeing a neutral line. And the citizens of Kushalanagar found themselves in the unenviable position of not knowing whether they were ruled by the town panchayat, which was not recognised following the Election Commission instructions, or the Gram Panchayat, which was ostensibly ""upgraded"" and hence no longer existing.At present, the Karnataka government is not releasing grants to the administration. When Gram Panchayat was the administrative unit, the town was receiving more than Rs 8 lakh in grants. The Panchayat forks out Rs 24 lakh for its 30 employees and office maintenance, for which it mops up Rs 23 lakh by way of levies and tax.Well, that's just about hand-to-mouth existence. Without government grants, the administration might as well bury its head in the sand and do an ostrich act. For, it makes no difference.Further, the Panchayat has no public representative. To bring the matter to the government's notice, the people boycotted the previous elections but that did not produce desired results. In the meantime, the chief officer has been transferred to steer clear of any controversies. Neither administrative decisions nor development works could be taken up in this town without its civic prince."	1
"KOLKATA: Be it cricket, Kargil or communalism, the media is showing lack of balance in reportage with a tendency to air voices of vested interests, newspaper editors said here on Thursday.""Large sections of the media have demonised Sikhs, Muslims and Christians. These reflect the ideas of our ''sources'', not our own,"" Uttam Sengupta, resident editor of the Times of India, Kolkata said.""Is it necessary to repeat what a Praveen Togadia, Ashok Singhal or Giriraj Kishore has to say ad infinitum?"" he asked speaking at a seminar on ''Communalism and the role of the media'' organised by the Press Club here.Stating that the media was ""mistaking the wood for the forest"" while reporting on communal issues, he charged the media of creating communal conflicts in the past.""Are we fair, are we non-partisan, should public good not come first and foremost?"" he asked.Pleading guilty of ''junk food'' journalism, he asked media policy makers to find a way to fix an ''objective agenda of reportage in a civil society''.Editor-in-Chief of The Statesman C R Irani, however, differed, pointing out that by keeping communal elements out of the front page, one could not stop them from moulding public opinion. ""It is necessary for us to allow Togadias to air their views so that people know how to deal with them,"" he said."	0
