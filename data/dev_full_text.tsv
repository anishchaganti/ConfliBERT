PUNE: Owners of paan (betel leaf) shops in the city on Monday warned that they would openly start selling gutkha if the civic body and the Food and Drug Administration failed to effectively implement the ban on gutkha, which came into force from October 2002. Addressing a news conference, Ramesh Vanjale, president of the newly formed Paan Association (PA), charged that gutkha was easily available at grocery shops and autorickshaw stands in the city despite the ban.aA one-rupee sachet of gutkha is being sold for Rs 4,a he said. Vanjale said that although gutkha factories in Maharashtra had been sealed, the sachets were being smuggled through private buses coming from Surat, Ahmedabad, Baroda and some parts of Karnataka. aA majority of our members stopped selling gutkha following the ban and suffered heavy losses. Now, we see grocery shops, general stores, rickshaw drivers and small time salesmen selling the product right under our noses,a he said. He claimed that members of his association had met municipal and FDA officials to apprise them of the clandestine sale of gutkha, but the transactions had not been checked. aThey conduct a couple of raids but things soon go back to normal,a Vanjale said and demanded that those found selling gutkha be given strict punishment and criminal cases be filed against them. He clarified that his association would not support any paan shop owner who violated the ban. The association has demanded that the fine for violation of gutkha ban be increased and licences of shops found selling gutkha be cancelled so that people would not dare to violate the ban. The association remarked that the authorities had managed to stop sale of gutkha completely during the first three months. aWe feel that flying squads need to be constituted to expose the sale of gutkha,a Vanjale added. Meanwhile, members of PA will take morcha to the Pune Municipal Corporation on May 1 to draw the attention of the civic body to the clandestine sale of gutkha in the city. aIf things do not improve, we will take another morcha to the mantralaya in Mumbai, and as a last resort, paan shop owners will openly start selling gutkha if no remedial action is taken,a Vanjale stated.	0

CHANDIGARH: The commissioner of police, New Delhi, is among those whom the Punjab and Haryana High Court vacation judge Justice Surinder Singh Grewal, on Friday issued notice for April 28. This was done following a habeas corpus writ filed by a Jalandhar-based lady doctor Maninder Minhas for getting her school-going daughter Jennifer released from the alleged illegal detention of Rajesh Kumar, a businessman who was perhaps planning to leave with her for Britain. Dr Maninder Minhas, a resident of Model Town, Jalandhar, who belongs to Punjab Civil Medical Service (PCMS), has submitted in her petition that Jennifer who was studying in 10 plus 2, was missing since Tuesday.

However, a phone call from someone who declined to divulge his identity disclosed that their daughter was seen in Delhi with one Rajesh Kumar who was on visiting terms with the family. The petitioner further alleged that in all probability her daughter was under illegal detention of Rajesh Kumar, who is a resident of Urban Estate Phase. I, Jalandhar and whom Jennifer addressed as uncle whenever the former visited the family. She apprehended that her daughter might be taken abroad by the accused since Jennifer also has a valid passport.

PUNE: A sea of humanity turned out for the funeral of RSS stalwart and former chief of the organisation Rajendra Singh alias Rajju Bhaiyya here on Tuesday evening. The mortal remains of the former Sarsanghachalak, who passed away in Pune on Monday noon following a massive heart attack, were consigned to flames at the Vaikunth crematorium. The pyre was lit by Gaurav Singh, nephew of Rajju Bhaiyya, in the presence of thousands of Swayamsevaks and political bigwigs, including Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, vice-president Bhaironsingh Shekhawat, deputy prime minister L.K.Advani, sarsanghachalak K.S. Sudarshan, Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal and Hind Mazdoor Sangh leader Dattopant Thengdi. Earlier, a huge procession was taken out from the Navin Marathi school in Shaniwar Peth to the crematorium. The procession, which lasted for nearly one-and-a-half hours, was the largest funeral procession witnessed by the city in the recent past. As the procession passed via the main thoroughfares of the city, including Laxmi Road, hundreds of citizens standing in balconies and on roof tops showered flowers on the specially decorated truck which carried the mortal remains of Rajju Bhaiyya. The task of the police was made easier as the RSS volunteers lived up to their tradition of maintaining discipline and formed a huge chain alongside the truck during the procession. The police estimated that about 15,000 swayamsevaks attended the funeral at Vaikunth. Apprehending the rush at the main gate, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had on Monday night broken a 10-metre section of the stone wall of the crematorium (on the electric crematorium side) and had prepared a separate tar road for the VIPs' entrance. Addressing the condolence meeting, Vajpayee recalled that the RSS was termed as an organisation of Brahmins till Rajju Bhaiyya took over the reins in 1994. aHis appointment to the post silenced the Sangh critics. Rajju Bhaiyya gave a new face to the organisation and, at the same time, ensured that the Sangh did not divert from the ideals of Hedgewar and Golwalkarguruji,a he said. aAlthough I often sought his advice, I could not work along with him as he functioned from Allahabad, while I was in Gwalior and Lucknow. However, he was one leader with whom I could speak very freely. He used to express his toughest ideas very clearly,a Vajpayee said. In his condolence speech, Sudarshan disclosed his discussions with Rajju Bhaiyya when the latter decided to step down from the post of sarsanghachalak and appoint him as his successor. aI brought to his notice that H.V. Sheshadri is much more senior to me and that he should be appointed as the sarsanghachalak. At that time, he told me that like him, Sheshadri too was not maintaining good health. He taught us that Swayamsevak should never be selfish. If we adopt his message and work for the progress of the Sangh, then this will be a true tribute to him,a Sudarshan said. Thengdi pointed out that Rajju Bhaiyya was an ideal Swayamsevak. Rashtra Sevika Dal leader Pratibhatai Medhi recalled that Rajju Bhaiyya had also helped the Dal in undertaking programmes for the welfare of women. Younger brothers of Rajju Bhaiyya, Vijendra Singh and Yatindra Singh, recalled that their elder brother was an expert in playing violin. The condolence speech of Advani and Shekhawat had to be cancelled owing to time constraint.	1
"VADODARA: All India Congress Committee (AICC) member and former Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) treasurer Anuj Patel was suspended by the central party leadership in Delhi on Wednesday for remaining absent during mayoral elections in Vadodara. A letter has been sent to the GPCC confirming the suspension.Sources in the Congress said the suspension note issued to Patel did not mention the period, and the order has been categorised as a ""soft suspension"".Unlike a sixyear suspension issued to the two women municipal councillors, Parvati Pandya and Hamida Khureshi, by the city congress unit, Patel can file a plea against the decision of the AICC in the committee's next board meeting.Senior Congress councillors said that it was during the visit of the central party observer for Gujarat, Vilasrao Deshmukh, that a representation was made by local Congress workers.Though the AICC remained divided over the issue, senior GPCC leaders said Deshmukh sought a soft suspension order by the committee.""Since Anuj was an AICC member and could not be suspended by the city unit or the GPCC, a written consent was sought in this regard from the central leadership. While the two municipal councillors who remained absent during the crucial mayoral elections were suspended, Patel''s disappearance on the same day was suspected and a motion was called against Patel in the GPCC,"" a Congress leader said."	0

MUMBAI: Raza Academy on Wednesday criticised the US for disregarding the United Nations and issuing a unilateral threat to attack Iraq. At press conference, members of the academy said the arrogance with which the US treated the concerns of the international community was 'unprecedented'.In protest, the academy was seriously considering calling for a fatwa on all American and British goods, except for medicines, Maulana Musannah Miyan of the All India Aimmae Masjid said at a press conference organised by the Academy.The Academy was discussing the proposed boycott with Muslim religious leaders in India and across the world, he added. The boycott will include withdrawing funds from American and British financial institutions and Raza Academy will soon forward a request to this effect to the Organisation of Islamic Countries, Maulana Miyan said.The victims of a war on Iraq would include children and women, academy members pointed out, adding that the US could very well decide to target Saudi Arabia or Iran in the same manner in the future.They were protesting the war as it was an attack on humanity and as the US was showing scant regard for a nation's sovereignty, Maulana Miyan said. aIt's not just a Muslim issue,'' he added. An oil-greedy American administration had ruthlessly brushed aside the voice of the European Community calling for areason and restraint'', Academy members said.	1
"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sore over the high command''s rejection of his proposal for the Rajya Sabha polls, KPCC President K Muraleedharan has submitted his resignation as the state unit chief to AICC President Sonia Gandhi.In his letter, Muraleedharan has urged Gandhi to relieve him of the responsibilities on April 8, a day after the Kerala Raksha Yatra campaign led by UDF Convener Oommen Chandy concludes at Kasargode, sources close to Muraleedharan said. When contacted, Muraleedharan confirmed he had sent ''a letter'' to the AICC chief, but refused to divulge the content. ""I cannot reveal the contents of the letter now,"" he said.The high command''s choice of former KPCC President Thennala Balakrishna Pillai alongwith AICC general secretary Vayalar Ravi as a ''compromise candidate'' for the election to the upper house to be held later this month appeared to have prompted the resignation.The high command chose Pillai overruling Muraleedharan''s suggestion of P C Chacko as the nominee for one of the two seats the party can win. Chacko''s candidature was stiffly opposed by K Karunakaran, who wanted one of the seats for a nominee of his choice. Muraleedharan pressed for Chacko''s candidature after the KPCC election committee authorised him and Chief Minister A K Antony to make recommendations to the high command."	0

GANDHINAGAR: The marine intrusion by Pakistani 'fishermen' off the Porbandar coast could not have been more alarming. It comes at a time when the Border Security Force has acquired its first vessel to be stationed on the Sir Creek area as a floating Border Outpost (BOP) and vindicates the need for policing the marine border.BSF officials say this vessel, scheduled to be commissioned before the onset of monsoon this year, will the first floating BOP along the Indo-Pak border in the country.The Sir Creek area, located between Kutch district of Gujarat and Pakistan, is the only disputed area where the border is not demarcated and stretches along 99 km, thus making it susceptible to intrusion.When the Kargil war was on, a Pakistani defence aircraft, 'Atlantique' was shot down by Indian defence forces close to the Sir Creek area when it was trying to enter Indian territory. The following year, an Indian Air Force helicopter mysteriously crashed in the creek area killing several IAF and BSF personnel, including a DIG of the BSF.Inspector General of the BSF (Rajasthan and Gujarat) OPS Mallik told TNN on Tuesday that the BSF plans to set up six floating Border Outposts in the marshy Sir Creek area, with the first one being at Koteshwar. This is a part execution of the proposal by the Union ministry of home affairs to secure the marine borders.The commissioning of the floating BOPs coincide with the fencing of the Indo-Pak border which is already on, beginning from Banaskantha district. The decision also comes close on the heels of the Pakistani cabinet approving communication links between Pakistani and Indian coast guards to detect violation of territorial waters. It is estimated that over 500 fishermen are caught by both countries every year for such violation. Security agencies on both sides believe that most of them are either infiltrators or spies, and their motives are hardly 'honourable'.  aEach floating BOP will comprise a 'mother ship' with four speedboats covering a specific area demarcated on the basis of the topography and ground realities,a said Mallik. The ship will have some 70-80 BSF personnel on board, complete with radio and wireless communication facilities and rations to sustain long hours of vigil. According to Mallik, it will be the first instance of riverine management and policing of the creek.Police sources indicate that amost of the influx of intruders is usually by the sea where they come under the guise of fishermen because the Sir Creek area is a mine of minerals and fish, hence a rich economic zonea.One vessel has already been acquired from the Mazagaon dock in Mumbai and may be commissioned as a floating BOP by July this year at Koteshwar. The concept of floating BOPs became a viable alternative considering the marshy terrain which made infiltration fairly easy. Sources said infiltrators usually operate with auto-mechanical boats in the sea area. These floating BOPs might also be provided with a helicopter. Some of the recent instances of violation of territorial waters include the seizure of an abandoned boat off the Salaya coast in Jamnagar which is believed to have landed six Pakistanis on Indian coast. On the co-ordination between security agencies, Mallik said, aThe Coast Guards job will begin where ours ends.a	1

"LUCKNOW: Union minister of state for home Swami Chinmayanand called for an all-party meeting to find an amicable out-of-court solution to the Ayodhya dispute.Lauding fresh initiatives by the Kanchi seer and Jayendra Saraswati and the prime minister in this regard, the Union minister said that an early solution to the century-old dispute was possible if the Congress and other opposition parties helped in creating a congenial atmosphere for talks and cooperate in the fresh initiatives.The minister pointed that the Kanchi seer's initiative came at the right time and the prime minister's assurance in the presence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi should be seen as a step in the right direction.Asked about the Congress silence on the issue, the minister said that it should be seen as the opposition''s tacit support for solving the dispute through talks. He said that though the government had yet to decide how to go about on the issue but it was not averse to convening an all-party meeting on the Ayodhya issue to push forward the seer''s initiative.There had been positive response from the Muslim organizations and those who had initially rejected the move would also join in once talks made some headway and took shape in the form of a concrete proposal or formula, he said. ""The VHP will also abide by it,"" he claimed when his attention was drawn towards the opposition by the VHP.He suggested for initiating talks at all levels. ""Talks should be held between religious heads, leaders of the two communities and even at political level to reach a consensus,"" he said claiming that only talks could pave the way for reaching a consensus on bringing a legislation to solve the dispute.Asked about BJP state president Vinay Katiyar raking up the temple issue, Swami Chinmayanand said that when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had already announced to keep the issue out of politics, then all parties, including the BJP, should refrain from doing so.Ridiculing VHP vice-president Giriraj Kishore for his controversial comments on Ram Janambhoomi Nyas chairman Mahant Ramchandra Paramhans Das suffering a stroke, the minister quipped: ""How could he make such comment when he was not even present during his meeting with Advaniji."" Kishore had stated that Mahant Das suffered a stroke after meeting Advani in Delhi recently.Swami Chinmayanand, who is also in-charge of the north-east, said that situation in the troubled states was fast improving and he was trying to hold talks with all warring groups. ""The Centre is open for talks with any Naga group to establish peace in the region. Some headway has been made and efforts are on to bring other groups too across the table,"" he said."	0
"PATNA: The killing of three innocent students in Ashiana Nagar area here by the police in an alleged 'fake' encounter on Saturday and also the killing of two persons in police firing at Manjhaul in Begusarai district recently, are likely to be made a big issue by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which is planning to launch a 1974-type ""people's agitation"" to overthrow the present Laloo-Rabri regime.Samata spokesman Shambhu Sharan Shrivastava, who reached here on Wednesday, informed mediapersons that the wrath of people in the wake of the 'fake encounter', which was manifest in the grand success of Patna bandh on Tuesday, has shown that a situation similar to 1974 prevails today and the only solution lies in overthrowing the present regime through a united movement.The party's national general secretary Satish Prasad, state vice-president Shyam Sunder Singh 'Dheeraj' and state spokesman P K Sinha, MLC, were also present at the press conference.

The issue involved is protection of human rights. ""If it is not possible to form a joint front of all opposition parties by rising above the party lines to launch a united agitation, there can be coordination between them for a synchronised movement to dislodge the present regime,"" he stated.Shrivastava also appealed to the Congress to withdraw from the present government, which no longer requires its support in the name of secularism to be in power, and give up its lust to be in power and apologise to the people for being a party in all the 'misdeeds' of the regime."	1

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has acquitted seven persons charged with looting and attempting to murder a Sikh during the 1984 riots, which rocked the capital in the aftermath of prime minister Indira Gandhi's assassination.Additional sessions judge Manju Goel acquitted accused Mamchand, Raj, Pappu, Hariprasad, Rajender, Ramchander and Dhaniram for want of evidence to link them to the charges.The police had filed an FIR in the case on the basis of a sworn statement given by one Surinder Kaur, a resident of Hari Nagar in south Delhi before the Justice Ranga Nath Mishra commission.Surinder Kaur had alleged that the accused, who were part of a 200-strong mob, forced their way into the house on November 1, 1984, and attacked her husband Harnam Singh.However, Harnam Singh managed to escape, she said adding the mob also looted their house. Harnam Singh even identified the accused in court. However, during cross examination he contradicted the version he had given to police.Surinder Kaur stuck to her allegations in court but said she had not identified the members of the mob who had attacked Harnam Singh. She further said that her neighbour Ram Singh had told her the names of the mob members immediately after the incident. However, Ram Singh - who testified as a defence witness - denied that any of the accused were part of the mob.Observing that Harnam Singh had not mentioned the names of the accused for several years after the unfortunate incidents, the court said there was reason to disbelieve his version and acquitted all accused.	1
"NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said here on Monday that there is no reason for the government to hesitate to open a dialogue with the elected representatives of the state as well as others, including Hurriyat Conference leaders, since the government is on a ""strong wicket"". Speaking to reporters here, he said: ""I don't understand why are they (the Centre) is shy of talking when we are on a strong wicket?"" He said the mood of the people in the Kashmir valley had totally changed.They wanted peace and development and to live with dignity. For the first time, the J&K people felt that they had the democratic power to change a government. ""So this opportunity should not be lost. There is no need for the government to be defensive any more,"" he said. He said that if talks could be held with the Naga rebel groups, then they could be held with all sections in J&K as well. Asked why there was a delay in holding talks with the separatists, including the Hurriyat leaders, the Mufti said: ""Prime Minister Vajpayee took several initiatives. Deputy chairman of the Planning Commission K C Pant was appointed as interlocutor but it was the Hurriyat which spurned the offer."" Asked about his response to the recent arrest of Hurriyat members for allegedly taking money from Pakistan high commission officials here, he said: ""I don't know. There may be some authentic reason. The government and the PM may be knowing about it."" To a question whether Pakistan should be involved in tripartite talks to resolve the Kashmir issue, the Mufti said: ""We should first put our house in order."" He refused to be drawn into any controversy over the present Indo-Pak stand-off, saying: ""The Centre knows better. Things must have gone wrong somewhere. That is why a decision has been taken to expel (the Pakistani deputy high commissioner and some other mission staff)."" He claimed that instances of human rights violations had drastically come down in J&K. Comparing the three-month period of his rule and that of Farooq Abdullah's rule, he claimed: ""There were only three cases of custodial killing against 32 in the past. In one of these, an FIR was registered against the station house officer of Mochu police station and he was arrested. The Army has also taken action against two officers allegedly involved in the other two cases."" He said while there were 43 rape cases from November 2001 to January 2002, only one case was reported between November 2002 and January 2003."	1
GHAZIABAD: The Indirapuram police on Sunday arrested four persons and rescued a Class 3 student who had reportedly been kidnapped by the accused from his school in Hardwar for a ransom of Rs 5 lakh. The police also recovered two pistols and some ammunition from their possession.Ghaziabad senior superintendent of police, Chandra Prakash, said Ashu, son of Pradeep Kumar of Hardwar, had been kidnapped from his school, Shanti Niketan Children's Academy on March 27.Prakash said the Kumar received several ransom calls on March 28. He said these calls were monitored by the Hardwar police and it was found that the calls were being made from Loni, Ghaziabad. The Ghaziabad police was informed and the Hardwar police coordinated their surveillance with them.Prakash said the Indirapuram station officer, Dharmendra Chauhan, received information that five men were driving down with the child from Loni to Bulandshahr, early on Sunday morning. ''At about 1.15 am, the police intercepted a Maruti car with six people at the Hindon Bridge, on National Highway 24. Ashu was recovered and four of his kidnappers nabbed. A fifth man managed to escape,'' said Prakash.	0
GULBARGA: Though it was quite well known that ministers were coming a-visiting, Health and Family Welfare Minister Kagodu Thimmappa''s visit came as a bit of a surprise to the Gulbarga District Health Office on Friday evening. Thimmappa spent more than three hours in the DHO, trying to sort out what he found to be a mess. He inspected all wings of the office, made a thorough inspection of records, and expressed dissatisfaction over the maintenance of the building, office premises and records. He was shocked to notice at least nine vehicles parked in the premises, disused and fit to be abandoned. He immediately summoned the RTO to the DHO and directed him to give the necessary fitness certificate after physical verification rather than prolonged tests.Officials complained to the minister that only 63 medical officers had been staying in the allotted quarters at primary health centres, while Gulbarga had 102 PHCs. Thimmappa directed the Chief Executive Officer of Gulbarga zilla panchayat to take action against those medical officers who were not residing in their quarters. It is mandatory that medical officers reside in the allotted quarters, he said. The CEO requested the minister to release Rs 53 lakh for the repairs of these quarters. Thimmappa observed the main reason for unsafe deliveries was non-availability of doctors and other hands at the PHCs. When his attention was drawn to negligence by junior engineers of the PWD and ZP engineering department in repairing PHCs though advance money had been sanctioned a good six months ahead, he instructed the CEO to file criminal cases against the engineers if they failed to return the advance. Taluk health officers had a technical grievance: lack of fax machines, to which the minister said that he had written a few weeks ago to all zilla panchayat presidents, asking them to release funds for fax machines for all taluk health offices. Since Gulbarga has reported at least 60 HIV-positive cases, the minister said that HIV testing equipment would be installed in Gulbarga Government Hospital shortly. The District Malaria Officer requested the minister to appoint 50 lab technicians and provide 50 microscopes to the district immediately.	0
"BHOPAL: Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday said unless the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre was removed from office nothing good can happen in the country.""Under this government, unemployment is increasing even as there is a steep rise in prices and corruption,"" Sonia said in her address at a massive Madhya Pradesh-level ''cooperative convention'' at the historic Lal Parade Ground here.She said that whatever was happening today had broken the common man''s back, there was total darkness all around and women were facing big burden.The area under agriculture was shrinking even as materials used in farming were becoming costlier and farmers were not getting enough price for their produce, Sonia said. The Congress president alleged that whenever BJP came to power either in the Centre or states, it worked for the destruction of the agriculture and cooperative sectors.In sharp contrast, the Congress had always worked for the betterment of the agriculture and cooperative sectors which were the backbone of our national economy, she said.The Congress president said the BJP and its allies believed in coming together only for the sake of their vested interests.She claimed that all the Congress governments in various states in the country were doing a better job than the NDA government at the Centre."	0
Wednesday was a day of success and failure, hope and dejection, growth and stagnation for hundreds of young boys and girls in Mumbai. For them it was a D-day on their career path. Yes, the Higher Secondary (12th) results were announced. As this result decides the career path, particularly for science students, it assumes lot of importance.In Mumbai 1.64 lakh students appeared and 1.37 lakh (83.95 per cent) passed.Mumbai''s performance is as usual much better than the overall state performance. Of the 7.44 lakh students appeared for the examination in the state 5.14 lakh (69.11 per cent) passed. Mumbai and Pune are the only two divisional boards out of total eight boards in the state, whose passing percentage is more than the overall state passing percentage. But Mumbai student could not achieve the position of the state topper. That honour went to Amravati.With the announcement of the results, the topic of immediate concern is depression, loss of hope, frustration etc. among the students, who failed or failed to get expected marks in order to safely secure admission to some good professional course. Due to tough competition, frustration is also so severe now a days that cases of suicide attempts had been reported after the results during last few years. However, some Samaritans have come forward and formed organisations to give a helping hand to such students to prevent any rash action.Maharashtra''s highly educated former minister Dr Shrikant Jichakar, who is known for securing large number of degrees from different disciplines, has also taken up this cause. In a recent speech he advised parents on what to expect and what not from their children and asked the students to approach him anytime if they feel frustrated due to bad result. With results out, the rush for admission to the higher education and professional courses will begin now. For some courses there will be CETs or institution level entrance tests, interviews etc. But for regular streams, it is normal admission process. Those who are just on the threshold of cut off percentage for professional courses, it will be a real headache till they secure a seat. They will have to first take some ''safe'' admission till they are successful in getting admission to the course and institution of their choice.Of course for all those who will secure the seats, the headache caused by tension will not conclude with their grand success of getting admission. No one knows when any disgruntle candidate will move to the court and stall the admission process. So, only when the classes begin the lucky ones will be able to relax.The main obstacle for middle class students this year for seeking admission to professional courses like engineering etc. is the new fee structure. All seats in private engineering and medical colleges have been made ''payment'' seats and college managements have been authorised to decide their own fee structure for them with the approval of the special authority created by the government for the purpose. Those students who will not be able to go to these courses despite securing good marks due to their inadequate financial condition, will naturally go to regular courses putting much more pressure on admissions to these regular colleges. The victims in this case will be those who are in the lower marks category as they will fine it difficult to get admissions to regular courses. Ultimately, as usual, the government will have to come to their rescue and arrange for their admissions. All these problems regarding admissions are worsening with every passing year, but none in the authority is coming out with some drastic solution. With general percentage rising to very high level, one way could be to raise the percentage for passing also. So that those who have secured above 35 will not be in a false notion that they have passed 12th exam but nowhere to go for further studies. Experts discuss alternatives on all these issues every year, but decision makers do not have time to pay attention to it.As we are on the topic of education, it is worthwhile mentioning here the approach of education department towards heritage sites. The old, picturesque bungalow of the dean of the JJ School of Arts in Mumbai is birthplace of Rudyard Kipling as his father was the first dean here in 19th century. As the bungalow is vacant now since no dean has been appointed, someone in the education ministry thought it fit to open an office of a government department here.After a lot of hue and cry by the artists and heritage lovers, the plan is abandoned now. But it speaks a lot on the approach of those in the government to look at such sensitive things. Is there a clash between the government machinery and sensitivity?	1
"SHIMLA: The stage is set for a battle-royal between the ruling BJP and Congress in the February 26 Assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh dominated by a campaign of personalised attacks, rebels and Himachal Vikas Congress candidates queering the pitch for the main two rivals in nearly 40 constituencies.In the remaining 20 constituencies it will virtually be a straight contest between BJP and Congress.Politics has touched a new low in the hill state with allegations against Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal levelled by his Congress counterpart from Punjab Amarinder Singh and BJP hitting back.Dhumal and BJP stalwarts, including Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, have now been forced to be on the defensive refuting allegations.The two sides have also resorted to legal recourse filing defamation suits against each other. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Congress President Sonia Gandhi have plans to undertake election campaign which is now being run by second rung leaders from both the parties criss-crossing the state. BJP also sees an advantage in Prime Minister''s connection with the state and claims that the ""liberal"" Central assistance to the state under his leadership will see the party through in the hustings."	1
PATNA: A chemistry professor was shot dead here on Saturday. Police suspect he was killed for refusing to pay extortion money. According to the police, Siddheshwar Lal, head of the post-graduate department of chemistry at Science College was on his way to college from his residence in his car when two motorcycle-borne youths fired at him at close range.His driver ran to his house to get help. ''I was shocked. Professor 'saheb' asked me to immediately inform his son about the incident. I left the vehicle and ran towards his house, only yards away. Later, he was brought to PMCH,'' said Lal's driver Pintu Kumar. He said there was no registration number on the killers' motorcycle. ''They (killers) were in their mid-twenties,'' he added. Sources in the police department said Lal had recently received calls from a criminal lodged in Beur jail and reportedly asked to pay extortion money for running a coaching institute in his house. On Friday, a police team had visited his residence and offered to provide security to him. But he had refused. Therefore, instructions were issued to a police picket near his house to remain alert.	1

LUCKNOW: You could be living a normal life, yet be unaware that you are a heart patient, even at the age of 30 years. Congenital heart disease is mostly detected at birth, but still there are cases of patients who remain ignorant of the problem for the better part of their lives. Although Meenakshi Mehra''s son was a ''blue baby'' - as he was detected with a hole in the heart (complex ventricular septal defect) - she was still a lucky mother. Lucky in the sense that her son showed the common symptoms of the problem and was subsequently cured by performing surgery. But sometimes, such cases pass the critical eye of doctors, thus posing a problem later in life. Also, there are some cases where surgical closure carries a high mortality.These are cases where transcatheter techniques should be attempted, said Dr Savitri Srivastava, head, department of congenital and paediatric heart diseases, Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi. A firm proponent of catheter interventions in congenital heart disease, she maintains that echocardiography, which is ultrasound-based should be done on all children. It has been established that 70 per cent of the total heart defects are there at the time of birth, said Dr Srivastava, who is here for the ninth annual conference of the UP chapter of Cardiological Society of India - CARDICON 2003, at the SGPGI.Moreover, Dr Srivastava added that muscular defects requiring ventriculotomy or residual VSD after prior surgical closure, was where a case could be made for transcatheter closure in order to avoid ventriculotomy. In the last decade, she said, the role of catheter interventions in therapeutic management of congenital heart disease had tremendously expanded and had completely revolutionised the role of cardiologists in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory.	0
"NEW YORK: Saddam Hussein's elder son, Uday, had approached US officials in Baghdad through an intermediary to negotiate a safe surrender, a media report said on Monday. A Hussein relative had approached an intermediary asking the US if Uday Hussein could ""work out something"" or ""get some kind of immunity,"" it was reported. ""From a hideout near Baghdad, Uday Hussein has reached out, hoping to strike a deal for his safe surrender,"" the report quoted a source as saying.The report also quoted a family servant and an unidentified source as saying that the deposed Iraqi leader, Uday and brother Qusay survived the two attempts made by the US during 'Operation Iraqi Freedom' to kill them. It added that one reason Baghdad fell so easily was that Qusay kept impulsively moving army units from one place to another, right till the last minute. Many of the units were simply out of position when the Americans arrived, one of the officers of the Republican Guards was quoted as saying. He said that the day before Baghdad fell, Qusay held a meeting with his top generals during which he kept repeating the same questions again and again. ""He looked nervous. He wasn't stable,"" the officer said."	0
"NEW DELHI: The BJP has objected to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh''s letter to US ambassador Robert Blackwill, requesting permission to send a jatha to Iraq to rebuild gurdwaras damaged during the war there.The party will write to external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha asking him to seek a clarification from Amarinder on the issue.Party spokesperson V K Malhotra said on Friday that Amarinder''s action in writing such a letter to Blackwill, without consulting the Centre, was not only""unconstitutional"" but also constituted the ""height of impropriety"".""Foreign affairs is a Central subject and the chief minister cannot correspond with foreign governments directly,"" he said.This kind of action by an Indian chief minister, Malhotra said, legitimises the US occupation of Iraq and goes against the spirit of the joint Parliament resolution which asked the US to withdraw its troops from Iraqi soil.Amarinder''s letter to Blackwill came after Congress president Sonia Gandhi advising him to take the initiative to rebuild gurdwaras damaged in Iraq."	0
NEW DELHI: A section of the teaching fraternity has come down heavily on Delhi University's (DU) move to ''increase working hours'' for teachers. They say this a move to implement the University Grants Commission (UGC) directive on 22 hours of teaching in a week.DU authorities, however, said these fears were misplaced and that the decisions were a result of demands by teachers over a period of time.At present, teachers in most DU colleges teach for 16.5 hours a week on an average.The Academic Council (AC) in a recent meeting adopted the recommendations of the Tandon Committee on Academic Reforms and Accountability. Among other things, teachers have taken exception to the recommendation for introducing a system of notifying three hours per week where teachers will be available to students for consultation.''This is simply an attempt to please the UGC. We don't have anything against staying for an extra three hours every week, but there is no need to mention this on the timetable. In due course, the contact hours will be converted to teaching hours,'' said Academics for Action and Development (AAD) chairman S S Rathi. He said the matter would be brought up in the executive council meet as well.According to him, the UGC recommendation for a 22-hour teaching week was struck down by the Delhi University Teachers' Association (DUTA) as it was aimed at proving that DU had surplus teaching staff. AC member Gurmohinder Singh also raked up the issue of infrastructure. ''The AC has resolved to introduce tutorials. We are not against the move, but a lot of colleges do not have enough classrooms for holding tutorials,'' he said. DUTA president Shaswati Majumdar said she did not have a problem with the recommendations apart from the quantification of contact hours.	0
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Friday issued notices to four convicts in the Parliament attack case on a trial court reference for confirming death sentence on three of the convicts and five years jail term to the wife of one of them.Taking cognizance of the reference placed before it, a division bench comprising Justice Usha Mehra and Justice Pradeep Nandrajog directed the Tihar jail superintendent to serve notices on them so that they could mark their presence in the case on February 3.Under the provision of the law the capital punishment awarded to a person by the trial court has to be confirmed by higher judiciary not less than a division bench.A special judge S N Dhingra had sentenced to death two Jaish-e-Mohammed militants -- Mohammad Afzal, Shaukat Hussain Guru -- and a city college lecturer S A R Geelani on December 18 while Shaukat''s wife Navjyot Sandhu alias Afsan was awarded five years rigorous imprisonment in the case.	1
"BHUJ/AHMEDABAD: With the Narmada water meandering its way into a canal at Samikhiyali village in Kutch district - about 600 km from the dam site - on Sunday, Medha Patkar may have to find a new cause soon. People from all over Kutch were a jubilant lot, despite scorching heat and sand storms. An emotional Vanita Trikam of Adhoi village could not help smile as she saw water flowing in this semi-arid region of Gujarat, for the first time in her life.For, from now on she will not be forced to undertake that back-breaking journey, every morning, with a pitcher on her head. Folk songs and dances marked the celebrations. Women had travelled several kilometres to Samikhiyali with pots to collect the Narmada water. Rava Dhira Ahir of Jangi village said he had tasted such sweet water for the first time in his life. ""Bo saru lage chhe (It tastes very nice)."" In the first phase, water will be provided to 70 villages of Bhachau and Rapar taluka where similar receptions will be organised to record the historic event. For this purpose, Narmada Swagat Samitis have been organised across Saurashtra and Kutch where some people have spent the second half of the last century hearing that Narmada will arrive at their door-steps some day. In Samakhiyali, the BJP government attempted to attach some religious significance to the event by making the water flow from a huge image of Lord Shiva. It might not be a torrent that entered Kutch, but for a district that has been perennially water starved, the Narmada waters at least holds the promise of alleviating the drinking water problems. The same is the case with the main cities of Saurashtra, where water supply was a rarity till last season. Cities like Rajkot and Jamnagar, used to 15 minutes of water supply once in three days, water allowances for employees and full water tankers as incentive to purchase white goods were quite in vogue. Needless to add water riots were not uncommon. But now things are a wee bit better."	1
NEW DELHI: As part of an exercise to resolve differences between the coalition partners BJP-BSP in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Mayawati had a meeting with top BJP leaders at the residence of Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, ahead of a meeting with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.The two-hour meeting at Advani''s residence discussed the nitty-gritty of smoothening out relations including the setting up of a coordination committee as also the three-point formula proposed at Friday night''s meeting.Immediately after the meeting at Advani''s residence, the leaders left for Vajpayee''s residence to have further talks to resolve the issue.The meeting was attended by HRD Minister Murli Manohar Joshi, BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu, party General Secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Uttar Pradesh leaders including state BJP President Vinay Katiyar, state incharge Kalraj Mishra and former Chief Minister Ram Prakash Gupta.Preceding the meeting, Naidu had a round of discussions with party leaders from Uttar Pradesh to ensure that the relations between the coalition partners are not disturbed.	0
"PATNA: With the arrest of four persons from Kadamkuan area, police claimed to have busted a gang of criminals involved in seeking extortion money from businessmen in Nala Road and Bari Path areas of the city. They were also involved in some snatching incidents.The foursome, including a peon of Patna Training College, were arrested from an area under Kadamkuan police station.When contacted, Town DSP R K Dubey said that the raiding team, which included Kadamkuan police station officer incharge Karm Lal, had recovered one countrymade pistol, four live bombs and 15 kg of powder meant for manufacturing bombs from the possession of the arrested persons.

One can manufacture at least 125 bombs by using the powder recovered from them,"" Dubey said.Those arrested have been identified as Yogendra Jha, peon, Chhotu Kumar alias Nirmal and Pinku alias Rakesh Kumar. Police are conducting raids to nab other members of the gang, including one Uttam, who is the son of the peon.Dubey said the gang had earlier demanded extortion money from a shop, Prem Hardware, located on Nala Road on May 31. ""However, the shopkeeper did not give information to police about the demand then. Later, the criminals lobbed a bomb near the shop. We started a probe and found the involvement of the same gang in the incident,"" Dubey said. He also admitted that the gang was a big headache for police. They were frequently committing incidents of road robberies in areas adjacent to Nala Road. Dubey also said that police had already traced other gangs involved in exploding bombs in Nala Road area to pressurise businessmen there to pay extortion money."	1
CHANDIGARH: Calling up a business associate in Shimla or a friend in Ambala will now not be possible if you are a Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) subscriber without an STD connection.With BSNL implementing the new tariff regime from Thursday, Punjab and Chandigarh subscribers will be forced to make STD calls to connect to phones outside the Punjab circle. The 95 code will not come in handy in case users want to dial phones installed in other circles, never mind even if the distance happens to be less than 200 km. However, the subscribers will gain on the swings what they lose on the roundabouts: Even non-STD BSNL users in Punjab will now be able to access all cities in the circle by using the 95 code, despite the distance being more than 200 km. Phone users will also be offered itemised bills at Rs 30 a month.Heavy users, with monthly rentals of Rs 750 and Rs 1,650 will get the bill free of cost. Under the new set-up, subscribers will be issued bills every month instead of bimonthly basis.The nigam has also introduced three new packages for urban and two for rural subscribers. The monthly rental on these packages varies from Rs 150 to Rs 1,650 (see box 1). Free calls available under different packages number between 150 and 1,800. Besides, the nigam will give its subscribers the option of choosing the ''general package'', which is similar to the existing package being availed by users.The only difference is that the number of free calls has been reduced from 75 to 30 for urban users and 250 to 50 for rural users. The rental for the general package (urban/rural) will be Rs 250/210 in Chandigarh and Rs 180/150 in Panchkula and Mohali. Caller line identification (CLI) facility, call waiting and forwarding will be offered free of cost to all users. All existing users will migrate to the general package unless they fill out a form to specify the package they want.	0
NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has asked University Grants Commission (UGC) to explain its position on a petition challenging the practice of granting re-employment to almost every teacher in Delhi University. The petition was filed by former Chief Justice of High Court, T P S Chawla, who is also a member of the governing board of Kalindi College and Moti Lal Nehru College.A division Bench comprising Chief Justice B C Patel and Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed directed the UGC to file a detailed affidavit by March 26, the next date of hearing, after finding the short affidavit unsatisfactory. The Bench also directed the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) to file an affidavit by the same date. The petition has been pending with the court for more than one year. The petitioner has contended that the practice of granting re-employment to almost every retiring lecturer has lead to virtually raising the retirement age from 62 to 65 years. The court had also issued notices to Moti Lal Nehru College and Kalindi College where some retired teachers had allegedly been re-employed without approval of their governing bodies, in violation of rules. The Bench had also directed the authorities to produce records granting extension to various retired teachers of the university and its affiliated colleges. The DU Ordinance-XII Rule III(3-A)(2) says re-employment could be given to retired teachers in rare cases, the petitioner said.	0
CHANDIGARH: Punjab IAS Officers' Association is anxious to put an end to the controversy triggered by its executive members' criticism of the recent moves of the chief secretary (CS) Rajan Kashyap.In a signed press note issued here on Wednesday, association's president BR Bajaj said the opinions of few members need not necessarily be the views of the entire association, as the association only provides a forum for frank exchange of ideas.Bajaj also said certain issues discussed in the executive committee on May 19 would be taken up formally with the CS and the chief minister to further the initiatives taken for good governance.Bajaj, however, has taken a position different from his colleagues who had opposed the CS for calling Punjab police chief MS Bhullar. Also, the joint touring by the police chief and the CS came under severe criticism as the IAS officers felt that police chief was just a head of a department (HOD). The CS should deal with HOD through administrative secretaries only, they had averred. Despite the association's attempt to wriggle out of it, the swapping of ex-cadre posts between IAS and IPS officers, joint touring bypassing HODs down to the district and tehsil level, and allied issues continued to be discussed among the IAS and IPS officers.The IAS officers asserted their superiority over all other services. ''After all, all those who joined IPS and other services failed to make it to IAS-the superior service,'' said an IAS officer.
